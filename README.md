#Enhancing Search Engine Relevance for Video Subtitles

Project Overview:
In the digital content landscape, an effective search engine is essential for connecting users with relevant information. This project focuses on improving the search relevance for video subtitles by developing an advanced search engine algorithm that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of search results.

Objective:
The primary objective is to create a robust search engine that accurately retrieves video subtitles based on user queries. This project emphasizes the use of semantic search techniques to understand the context and meaning behind user queries, ensuring that search results are relevant and contextually appropriate.

Key Components:

Vectorization: Subtitle documents and user queries are vectorized using BERT-based SentenceTransformers, which capture the semantic meaning of the text.

Cosine Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity between the document vectors and the query vector is computed to determine the relevance of the documents, and the most relevant documents are returned.

Document Chunking:
Large subtitle documents are divided into smaller chunks to avoid information loss and ensure precise embedding. Overlapping windows are used to maintain context between chunks.

Data Storage:
Embeddings are stored in a ChromaDB database, enabling efficient and quick retrieval during search queries.

Process Workflow:

Ingesting Documents:
Subtitle data is read, cleaned, vectorized, and split into manageable chunks to preserve contextual information.

Retrieving Documents:
The user's search query, which may be in audio format, is processed and converted into an embedding.
The cosine similarity between the query embedding and document embeddings is calculated to rank document relevance.
The top-ranked documents are returned as search results, ensuring an accurate and context-aware search experience.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of semantic search techniques in enhancing the relevance of video subtitle search results. By focusing on understanding the context and meaning of both queries and documents, this approach provides a superior search experience tailored for subtitle content.
