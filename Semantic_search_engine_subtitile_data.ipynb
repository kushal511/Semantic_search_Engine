mindful of petty cost 514 when god set down tongue of fire upon the head of christ apostle 515 so they could speak the many language of the world 516 that they knew not before 517 but do such miracle happen in our time 518 ive heard enough youve made a poor case 519 when we suffered persecution in mecca 520 muhammad told u go to abyssinia 521 the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged

collect yourself 542 i speak of the messenger of god 543 muhammad teach u to worship one god 544 to speak truth 545 to love our neighbor a ourselves 546 to give charity even a smile can be charity 547 to protect woman from misuse 548 to shelter orphan 549 and to turn away from god of wood and stone 550 i can not keep still and hear this blasphemy 551 we are an ancient civilization 552 to call our god wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them 553 the idolthe form is not what we worship 554 but the spirit that resides within the form 555 i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood 556 thank you 557 now let me bring him back to the woman 558 god made woman to be the proper companion of man 559 she is different but equal 560 equal 561 we buy them 562 feed them clothe them 563 use

miracle 508 that we may recognize them 509 the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran 510 a book a book 511 written by an illiterate attributed to god 512 i think the emperor ha had enough 513 im mindful of petty cost 514 when god set down tongue of fire upon the head of christ apostle 515 so they could speak the many language of the world 516 that they knew not before 517 but do such miracle happen in our time 518 ive heard enough youve made a poor case 519 when we suffered persecution in mecca 520 muhammad told u go to abyssinia 521 the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged 522 what they call persecution wa fair punishment 523 that is order now 524 why did your prophet send you to me 525 because you believe in the book of the one god a we do 526 he sent u because in your heart god will protect u 527 talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage 528 but theyve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend 529 go on 530 for year we worshiped wood and stone 531 image of our own manufacture 532 we lived in ignorance of god 533 we had few earthly law and no heavenly law 534 the rich neglect the poor 535 and the natural pity of man 536 whereby he lift his brother up when he ha fallen 537 is described by them a upsetting social order 538 to this inhumanity ha come a man 539 whom god chose 540 and in that we believe 541 youve overcome i beg you to collect yourself 542 i speak of the messenger of god 543 muhammad teach u to worship one god 544 to speak truth 545 to love our neighbor a ourselves 546 to give charity even a smile can be charity 547 to protect woman from misuse 548 to shelter orphan 549 and to turn away from god of wood and stone 550 i can not keep still and hear this blasphemy 551 we are an ancient civilization 552 to call our god wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them 553 the idolthe form is not what we worship 554 but the spirit that resides within the form 555 i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood 556 thank you 557 now let me bring him back to the woman 558 god made woman to be the proper companion of man 559 she is different but equal 560 equal 561 we buy them 562 feed them clothe them 563 use them discard them 564 woman equal to u 565 god created man from one male and one female 566 amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you 567 why are your 300 guard so tonguetied 568 while this only guard is eloquent 569 god ha spoken to u before 570 through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ 571 why should we be so surprised that god speaks to u now through muhammad 572 who taught you those name 573 they are named in the quran 574 i knew muhammad when he wa an orphan minding sheep 575 and we knew christ a a carpenter 576 what christ say and what your muhammad say 577 is like two raised from the same land 578 they are lying to you they deny christ 579 you worship three god they say father son and holy ghost they say 580 what do you say of christ 581 they say god can not have a son 582 christ is not the son of god 583 speak to me of christ 584 we say of christ what our prophet ha taught u 585 that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary 586 and that she conceived christ the apostle of god 587 the apostle he say not the son not the son 588 what doe your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ 589 may i relate the word 590 come closer to me 591 in the name of god most gracious most merciful 592 relate in the book the story of mary 593 how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east 594 how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said 595 i am a messenger from your god 596 to announce the birth of a holy son to you 597 she said how shall i mary have a son when no man ha touched me 598 and gabriel

he never asked more from you 634 than one word 635 one 636 one god 637 if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten word 638 but the word he want would dethrone all the god 639 you were afraid even to hear him 640 iwith the death of his uncle muhammad ha now lost all protectioni 641 ihe wa no longer safe in meccai 642 ialone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside

the world were framed by the word of god 7 abel 8 enoch 9 noah 10 abraham 11 sarah 12 these all died in faith 13 not having received the promise 14 but having seen them afar off 15 and being persuaded of them and embracing them 16 and confessing that they were but stranger 17 and pilgrim on the earth 18 for they that say such thing declare plainly 19 that they seek another country 20 and truly if they had been mindful of that country 21 from whence they came out 22 they might have had opportunity to return 23 but they desired a better country 24 that is a heavenly one 25 wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god 26 and he hath prepared for them a city 27 i think william bradford knew 28 they were on a journey in this world towards heaven 29 they didnt know quite how they would get there 30 or where they would finally meet their end 31 but i think thats what he meant 32 they were on a journey 33 they were transient citizen of the world 34 and ultimately citizen of heaven 35 and they were on a journey towards purity 36 thats what they sought 37 thats what took them out of england 38 thats what took them over to holland 39 thats what took them from holland 40 over to the new world 41 summer wa fading fast and the window for attempting 42 the long and dangerous ocean crossing 43 had already started to close when on september 6 1620 44 an aging 180ton ship called the imayfloweri 45 weighed anchor off plymouth off the south coast of england 46 and set out on her own across the north atlantic 47 on what would prove to be 48 one of the most historic voyage of the millennium 49 it worth reminding ourselves that at the time 50 they were a very very small group of very extreme people 51 and if wed never heard of them ever again 52 nobody would be surprised 53 and most english people thought that they were well rid of them 54 the fact that they are in the long term 55 extraordinarily successful 56 that they found the world greatest democracy 57 throw retrospective luster 58 they are one might say if you wanted to be critical 59 theyre religious nutter who wont settle for anything 60 except the most literal reading of the bible 61 they want to transform a nationstate 62 into something that resembles 63 what they take to be a godly kingdom 64 they werent the people that you would expect 65 to be founding a new colony 66 they werent soldier 67 they were not emissary of a foreign government 68 they were not particularly well provided with supply 69 and at least half of them were separatist 70 that is to say radical protestant 71 who were religious exile 72 who had been living in leiden in the dutch republic 73 they werent the people you would automatically expect 74 to be founding a new outpost of the british empire 75 they were in many way the least likely of task force 76 for establishing a permanent english presence 77 in the new world 78 fewer than 50 of the 102 passenger were adult men 79 many well past their physical prime 80 at least 30 were child and nearly 20 were woman 81 including three expectant mother 82 by the time they set sail in the fall of 1620 83 england had still not succeeded in establishing 84 a truly viable colony on the shore of the new world 85 and their chance of survival let alone success 86 were all but nil 87 when you look at jamestown in virginia by 1620 88 theyd pumped in something like 8000 colonist there 89 and yet they were struggling to keep their number above 1000 90 the death rate wa awful so it wa a very dangerous step 91 to even contemplate 92 especially given the number of people on the imayfloweri 93 they dont register at all numerically 94 it a tiny handful of people many of whom dont survive 95 were thinking about migration to the america 96 in the 17th and 18th century 97 were talking about ten million african for instance 98 a against this tiny handful of englishman and woman 99 the fascinating thing then about the pilgrim story 100 is how this tiny group of people managed to get by 101 and managed to tell the story in such a way 102 a to erase that whole other history 103 if you ask people 104 where doe america start 105 theyll say it start at plymouth rock 106 despite the fact that jamestown wa founded in 1607 107 and plymouth wa founded in 1620 108 it became our story of national origin 109 somehow with the passage of time 110 the arrival of this frail unlikely band 111 would come to be seen a the true founding moment of america 112 and the story of their coming enshrined 113 a the quintessential myth of american origin 114 commemorated each year 115 on the fourth thursday in november at thanksgiving 116 and embodied in a handful 117 of iconic and instantly recognizable image 118 including a rock and a ship 119 and a feast that almost certainly never took place 120 a we imagine it did 121 i think we feel that were such a new country 122 that we need to know how it all began 123 we need that beginning moment 124 and the pilgrim serve that purpose 125 but what people forget is that it wasnt all fated 126 these were normal people under extraordinary circumstance 127 and they were making it up a they went along 128 and it end up being a much a story of survival 129 a it is a story of origin 130 what no one could have imagined in the fall of 1620 131 a autumn wind blew the 102 passenger of the imayfloweri 132 west across the atlantic 133 wa how harrowing dark and deeply unsettling 134 their pilgrimage to the new world would be 135 or how utterly their quest for a godly republic 136 would transform the world they were sailing towards 137 the searcher themselves 138 and the nation that would rise up 139 long after they were gone consecrated to their memory 140 because the pilgrim have been so enshrined 141 in the national imagination because theyve meant so much 142 in what weve told ourselves about who we are a american 143 we need to go back and ask question 144 about why we picked that story 145 what it wa about these people what it wa about their history 146 that we wanted to see reflected in our own national image 147 there been a tremendous amount of memory produced 148 around the pilgrim 149 but there also been a lot of forgetting 150 you know that memory is very selective 151 and so to look at whats been remembered 152 and let that shed light on whats been forgotten 153 is an important exercise 154 when were thinking about something 155 that ha been so central to our national imagination 156 the difference is bradford 157 not simply because he wa the governor 158 for many many year 159 but because of his personal quality 160 he wa a person of very delicate sensibility 161 and very keen perception 162 and he watched the fluttering of their little conventicle 163 and it ups and down with the greatest concern 164 and registered it in this wonderful prose 165 to a remarkable degree 166 we would scarcely remember the pilgrim at all 167 and certainly not remember them a we do 168 were it not for the unusual man 169 who came to be lead them in the new world 170 and the unusual book he left behind 171 a luminous text unlike any other account 172 of early american settlement 173 extraordinary both in what it say 174 and in what it pass over in silence 175 bradford of plymouth plantation 176 is one of the great book of american literature and history 177 that book more than anything 178 is a kind of bible in it own way 179 it steeped in the bible obviously 180 when it come to it language 181 but when it come to the history of plymouth colony 182 it is ithei text 183 and there stuff there that is very dark and turbulent 184 he labored over the manuscript for more than 20 year 185 scribbled writing he said pieced up in time of leisure 186 stolen from his duty a governor 187 and written in the third person a if to a far distant future 188 he left the manuscript to his son and heir 189 the day he died in 1657 along with a handful of simple poem 190 written in the first person 191 the book itself almost never came down to posterity 192 in bradford role a a historian 193 he ha the possibility of success 194 because he ha the possibility to shape that history 195 he get to write for posterity he get to shape the story 196 bradford is clearly writing for a future 197 plymouth he understands will have it future in it history 198 and he the one who creating that history 199 from my year young in day of youth 200 god did make known to me his truth 201 and called me from my native place 202 for to enjoy the mean of grace 203 in wilderness he did me guide 204 and in strange land for me provide 205 in fear and want through weal and woe 206 a pilgrim passed i to and fro 207 in england the place that is most closely associated 208 with the origin of the pilgrim is a village called scrooby 209 which is right at the northern corner 210 of the county of nottinghamshire 211 it about 150 mile north of london 212 it wa an area where religious division 213 were particularly conspicuous 214 where there wa still quite a large number 215 of lingering roman catholic 216 an area which had recently been evangelized 217 by radical protestantism 218 you have the right people at the right time 219 in the right area with the same idea 220 and i think thats what happened up here 221 in this part of the country 222 got john robinson at gainsborough 223 youve got william brewster there at scrooby 224 you have richard clifton here at babworth 225 you have william bradford in austerfield 226 so spiritually strong and so young 227 they supported each other 228 and i think that is why it took off here 229 and maybe not in other place 230 he wa born in the tiny village of austerfield 231 in south yorkshire and baptized on march 19 1590 232 in the ancient stone church of st helena 233 a threemile walk down a path called low common lane 234 from the village of scrooby 235 with farmland of their own and a sturdy house 236 his family though far from wealthy 237 were far from poor especially compared with their neighbor 238 tenant farmer and landless field hand 239 for the most part 240 but his childhood would be blighted 241 by the death of virtually everyone close to him 242 his father william when he wa one 243 his grandfather william when he wa six 244 his mother alice when he wa seven 245 his sister alice and his grandfather john hanson 246 when he wa 12 247 he wa sent to live with his uncle robert 248 who hoped he would prove useful working in the field 249 by then his family economic security had been badly shaken 250 by four failed harvest in a row 251 the great dearth of the 1590s 252 and by the devastating depression that followed 253 the standard of living of the average english laborer 254 wa rapidly declining 255 it wa something very close to famine 256 so it wa a very uncertain world 257 in which even people from the yeomanry 258 a the pilgrim were were always worried 259 they were about to slip back into this state 260 of neardestitution in which many people lived 261 and in addition to that 262 the kind of people who became the nucleus of plymouth colony 263 honestly believed that in england 264 they were being forced to live amid sin amid iniquity 265 and there is evidence that 266 there wa a great deal of immorality going on 267 incident of fornication incident of adultery 268 drunkenness 269 and what emerges from this is a picture of quite a troubled 270 and disturbed and agitated world 271 lonely and intelligent in a world that felt 272 increasingly precarious and unmoored to him 273 he fell ill when he wa 12 274 with what he called a long sickness 275 which took him from the field kept him bedridden for month 276 and drove him to seek solace in the bible 277 the reading of scripture he said 278 made a great impression upon him 279 and the more he read the more troubled he became 280 at the gulf between the world he saw around him 281 and the simplicity and purity of the gospel 282 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name 283 he had this profound sense a a 12 year old 284 that the congregation he wa a part of wa corrupt 285 that the church wa moving them 286 in a direction that wa not right 287 that they prayed to the depraved belief of mortal men 288 that were moving them away from god 289 and so this wa a deep conviction 290 and i think there you have the beginning 291 of a very complex inwardlooking person 292 who wa improbably preparing for the ultimate journey 293 when he wa well again he went with a friend 294 to all saint church at babworth ten mile away 295 to hear the illuminating ministry 296 of a forwardthinking puritan preacher named richard clyfton 297 not long after he found his way down low common lane 298 to the home of william brewster 299 the warmhearted cambridgeeducated postmaster 300 and bailiff of scrooby manor 301 where he came to feel he had found a spiritual home 302 and where each week a private congregation gathered 303 to hear richard clyfton 304 and another charismatic minister named john robinson 305 preach on the need to purify worship of everything worldly 306 of anything not contained in scripture 307 your carcass shall fall 308 i think the sense of faithfulness to scripture 309 is at the heart of it 310 let u pray 311 they want to go right back to the root 312 and strip away all the human accretion 313 that have come into the worship and the life of the church 314 and get back to a primitive purity 315 it no accident that the larger movement 316 from which the separatist came 317 were called puritan by their opponent 318 because thats what they were campaigning for 319 greater purity greater faithfulness 320 to what they believed they read in scripture 321 nothing he read made a deeper impression on him 322 than a passage from the book of st matthew 323 in which christ explains to his disciple 324 where the true church lie 325 for where two or three are gathered together in my name 326 there am i in the midst of them 327 thats obviously 328 the key separatist text 329 that christ will be with you without a bishop 330 without a church 331 without any clear ecclesiastical organization 332 and that prayer conversion commitment 333 is enough for the presence of christ 334 thats an extraordinarily radical text 335 when you think about it 336 they reject hierarchy in the church 337 the hierarchy of bishop priest and deacon 338 that ha come from catholicism 339 that still exists in the church of england 340 so they look for an equality among member of the church 341 thats an equality of member of the body of christ 342 everybodys got equal access to it 343 it a powerful idea to think that you can 344 in an unmediated way see god 345 the bible is your window in 346 and to have a bishop or a pope telling you what to do 347 is just getting in the way is so much fallen static 348 and it a powerful idea 349 i think it particularly powerful 350 for someone like bradford who find himself alone at 12 351 and to think that god is that accessible 352 that if he can find just a few others 353 and have a congregation of people 354 on the same wavelength 355 that they can find their way to god 356 thats what you need 357 thats all you need 358 and youre willing to go 359 to the end of the earth literally 360 if you know that you will be following that path 361 they are withdrawing from the world 362 they are being called out of the world 363 to this pure worship of god 364 it a desire to worship worship truly and purely 365 and god will gather those who are called to this 366 by 1603 he wa fully committed to the radical idea 367 that the true love of god might mean separating 368 from the church of england altogether 369 and thats when the real trouble begin 370 because you look at who the head 371 of the only church in england 372 the head of the church from henry time is the monarch 373 it not just the church 374 it the monarch that youre flying in the face of 375 thats what make this so dangerous 376 and so worrying for the authority 377 because if youre going to make a stand on religion 378 and get away with it 379 then what else are you going to make a stand on 380 your carcass will fall in the wilderness 381 the issue at stake 382 are literally more important than life and death 383 it your eternal life or your eternal death 384 and if your monarch is jeopardizing your eternal life 385 youre a very unreliable subject 386 because anyone who separate from the church 387 is not just separating from the church 388 but theyre separating from royal authority 389 and thats potentially very dangerous 390 bottom line what wa at stake 391 well their life 392 you can punish somebody for not attending a church 393 you can be fined and it wa 20 pound in those day 394 about 9000 pound in today money 395 thats a lot of money just for not going to church 396 if you persisted then you could be imprisoned 397 so you could think about it 398 and elizabeth after the act against puritan in 1593 399 had made the next step banishment 400 but i think with james 401 the next step could have been death for these people 402 he wa newly to the throne not popular 403 he wasnt going to have any dissenter 404 so i really think that these folk were risking everything 405 you cant really understand the pilgrim story 406 without understanding james i 407 who wa king of england at the time 408 the man from whom they were fleeing 409 james i wa a man who passionately believed in unity 410 he believed that it wa immensely important 411 that the kingdom should be unified 412 under a single canopy of law and order 413 and he didnt want to see any form of discord 414 or the creation of rival faction 415 rival center of power 416 and in area like this 417 where people had been perhaps able to get away with thing 418 there wa a new drive to make sure 419 that everyone conformed to the church of england 420 and there were explicit rule that said 421 you couldnt have private religious meeting in house 422 minister should not convene private group of people 423 these conventicle were judged illegal 424 and subversive to order in the realm 425 and for that reason a network of people here 426 came to feel that they were under pressure 427 in the fall of 1607 428 when william brewster himself wa fined 429 and threatened with imprisonment 430 it wa clear that only one option remained 431 to worship god a they saw fit 432 they must separate not only from the english church 433 but from england altogether 434 holland had emerged 435 a the protestant part of the netherlands 436 opposed to catholic rule in the south 437 it wa a place of refuge for evangelicals 438 in a time of threat and challenge 439 that looked like the place 440 where god purpose might be being served 441 it wa also a boom time 442 because peace brought an expansion in the cloth trade 443 so you can see the attraction 444 from here to the humber estuary and to amsterdam 445 is not very far 446 but they couldnt just leave the country 447 because you needed permission to pas port 448 and dissenter werent going to get permission 449 to leave the country 450 theyd have to escape from their own country 451 a first desperate attempt to flee ended in disaster 452 when the english sea captain they had hired 453 betrayed them to the authority 454 eight month later 455 on a clouddarkened evening in the spring of 1608 456 they tried again some fleeing by barge 457 down the trent and the humber towards hull 458 where this time 16 of the men 459 including 18yearold william bradford 460 managed to board a dutch ship and get away to sea 461 one step ahead of the searcher in pursuit 462 who arrested the terrified woman and child 463 and carted them off to jail 464 they were soon released 465 and over the next year in group of two and three 466 quietly made their way across the north sea to amsterdam 467 and joined their friend and family member in exile 468 and so they join the radical protestant of their time 469 the dutch 470 and james for the monarchy wa let them go there 471 if thats where theyre happy 472 no reason why they shouldnt go there 473 the dutch are our ally 474 weve been fighting on the side of the dutch 475 if you want to live there fair enough 476 good riddance 477 and no doubt many of them would have thought 478 that they would settle there quite happily 479 and that would be it 480 these folk mainly were tied to the land 481 they were used to england 482 a far a we know 483 only william brewster spoke the language 484 and youre going to a country 485 where you dont speak the language 486 you dont know the custom 487 how are you going to survive 488 and there wa no coming back 489 in 1609 fearing the congregation would come apart 490 in the sprawling dutch metropolis 491 william brewster and john robinson 492 led their people 22 mile south to the city of leiden 493 a university town 494 and the bustling heart of the dutch textile industry 495 holland wa a completely different environment 496 from what they were used to 497 and because they were foreigner 498 they ended up getting really lousy job 499 instead of farm they ended up basically in little factory 500 creating clothing 501 and they would work literally from dawn till dusk 502 a bell would go off in the morning 503 and theyd work to the very end of the day 504 often with their child 505 with no family of his own william bradford found lodging 506 in a poor neighborhood called stink alley 507 until at 21 he wa able to set up shop 508 in a small house of his own 509 toiling six and sometimes seven day a week a a weaver 510 it clear that many of them found it very harsh 511 the climate wa far harsher than they expected 512 the difficulty that they encountered were much greater 513 but for all the trial and hardship 514 they would look back on these year 515 with an almost rapturous longing and nostalgia 516 for the world they created around them there 517 free for the first time to worship a they wished 518 in accordance with god will unmolested 519 such wa the true piety the humble zeal 520 and fervent love of this people whilst they thus lived together 521 towards god and his way 522 and the single heartedness 523 and sincere affection one towards another 524 that they came a near the primitive pattern 525 of the first church 526 a any other church of these latter time have done 527 i think there something about what you might call 528 the glory day in leiden 529 the community that john robinson build around himself 530 his house the sort of cottage surrounding it 531 the meeting hall 532 it very much based on what they read 533 in the letter of the early church 534 paul letter in the new testament 535 about what it mean to be a community 536 in the body of christ 537 they would take a vision of what that had been for them in leiden 538 across the atlantic to the new world 539 in 1613 william bradford 540 married a young english woman named dorothy may 541 not in a religious service performed in a church 542 but in a civil ceremony at leiden grand city hall 543 in accordance with dutch custom 544 and because the separatist found no precedent in the bible 545 for churchordained wedding 546 it wa the beginning of the separation of church and state 547 another custom they would take with them across the atlantic 548 sooner than anyone could have imagined 549 a by 1617 it had begun to be clear 550 that leiden wa not the promised land after all 551 their biggest concern after a decade in this foreign land 552 wa that their child were becoming dutch 553 and these people had decided to leave england 554 for their religious belief 555 but they were still very proud of their english heritage 556 and so if we stay in holland 557 we will lose the identity that is so essential to who we are 558 they were also fearful 559 that the spanish were about to attack again 560 thered been a building confrontation 561 between the catholic king of spain 562 and protestant power in europe 563 and in 1618 it look like the holy roman empire 564 is about to dissolve into religious war 565 in which all the power of europe 566 are going to become involved 567 and indeed that is what happened 568 in late november 1618 569 a brilliant bluegreen comet appeared in the night sky 570 we shall have war 571 the english ambassador to the netherlands wrote 572 and he wa right 573 europe wa on the verge of an enormous conflict 574 the beginning of what we now refer to 575 a the thirty year war a great religious conflict 576 involving all the great power of europe 577 which protestant such a the pilgrim saw 578 a a great confrontation between good 579 in the shape of protestant christianity 580 and evil in the shape of roman catholicism 581 and this in the eye of many 582 wa a cataclysmic global confrontation 583 which might very well lead to the end of the world 584 it might herald if you like 585 the second coming of christ and the day of judgment 586 thing were that urgent the stake were that high 587 everything seemed to be on the edge of complete meltdown 588 and so they decided it time to pull the rip cord once again 589 even if it meant leaving everything they had known 590 all their life 591 but where do you go 592 youre englishman after all 593 but you cant go back to england 594 and i think thats why they plumped for the new world 595 if you cant go back to england at least maybe they could find 596 the freedom theyre looking for there 597 after weighing and rejecting numerous option 598 they settled in the end 599 on an area at the mouth of the hudson river 600 near present day new york 601 in the northern most part of the english colony 602 founded by the virginia company 603 then set out to try and get a legal charter 604 and permission to emigrate 605 what they had to do to get there required an awful lot of them 606 they really had to figure out how they were going to do this 607 and like many people from cult they were really naive 608 when it came to the rest of the world 609 and so it meant that they were very prone to being duped 610 when it came to trying to figure out 611 how are we going to do this 612 who are we going to hire 613 who going to be our military officer 614 where are we going to find a ship 615 who going to finance this endeavor 616 and these were not wealthy people 617 and so they had this huge list of problem 618 they had all but despaired of finding anyone 619 willing to finance the hugely costly highrisk undertaking 620 when in early 1620 they were approached in leiden 621 by a 35yearold broker from london named thomas weston 622 who offered to organize financing for the expedition 623 through a group called 624 the fellowship of the merchant adventurer 625 and that is the beginning of all sort of trouble for them 626 the right time to make that westward crossing 627 of the atlantic to the new world is to set out in the spring 628 and certainly no later than the summer 629 because of the way that the prevailing wind are working 630 and so on 631 so the pilgrim get themselves ready in leiden in the spring 632 and it june when they discover that weston 633 hasnt organized any transport 634 to their deep dismay weston also now informed them 635 that the investor were getting cold foot 636 and insisting that nonseparatist outsider 637 go along with them 638 the prospect wa appalling 639 but there wa nothing they could do 640 in june with no word about financing 641 or the ship weston swore 642 would be waiting for them in southampton 643 they arranged their own passage across the english channel 644 on an aging vessel called the ispeedwelli 645 on july 22 they bid a heartwrenching farewell 646 to those staying behind including pastor robinson 647 who it wa decided would remain in leiden 648 with the main congregation 649 until a secure beachhead had been established 650 in anguish william and dorothy bradford 651 left their threeyearold son john in the care of relative 652 there wa deep sorrow 653 at the bottom of this decision for many of them 654 a they got on the boat 655 they knew at least most of them 656 had no chance to come back 657 they were never going to see the people 658 who had meant the most to them up to that point 659 they were going to something they could barely imagine 660 and so they left that goodly and pleasant city 661 which had been their resting place near 12 year 662 but they knew they were pilgrim 663 and looked not much on these thing 664 but lift up their eye to the heaven 665 their dearest country and quieted their spirit 666 the journey across the channel to southampton 667 wa swift and uneventful 668 and when they arrived to their enormous relief 669 they found waiting for them at the dock a second ship 670 which thomas weston had secured for them 671 at the last possible moment 672 a mediumsized 180ton squarerigged merchant vessel 673 battered from use 674 but at 100 foot three time longer than the speedwell 675 seasoned and sweetened 676 from year of shuttling across the channel 677 taking bale of wool to france 678 and barrel of wine back to england 679 it wa called the imayfloweri 680 here too they had their first encounter 681 with the imayflowersi captain christopher jones 682 and with it hardbitten roughandtumble crew 683 and with the stranger 684 the motley assortment of nonseparatist recruit 685 the investor had insisted go with them 686 suddenly these leideners who had spent ten year 687 cultivating their own spiritual and very inward bond 688 found themselves on a ship 689 sharing their space with the stranger 690 who came from a completely different place 691 with the understanding that 692 were not just sharing the ship with them 693 were going to be living with these people 694 for the foreseeable future 695 the imayfloweri and the ispeedwelli 696 had finally weighed anchor 697 and were just beginning to make headway 698 when to their shock and dismay 699 the ispeedwelli began to wallow and take on water 700 it sprang leak like a sieve 701 they kept on having to put back into port 702 because the ispeedwelli wa leaking 703 and finally in plymouth 704 they had to abandon the ispeedwelli altogether 705 and everyone went aboard the imayfloweri and set off 706 it wa up to the imayfloweri now to sail on on her own 707 crowded with a many passenger from both ship 708 a she could hold 709 many had to be left behind 710 when all wa said and done 711 there were only 102 passenger on board 712 only half of whom were member 713 of the original leiden congregation 714 it wa a long process 715 before they could finally get away to sea 716 out onto the open atlantic 717 and it wa far too late in the year 718 if you wanted to go to america to virginia or new england 719 you should try to leave february or march at the latest 720 so you could get there in the spring 721 and give yourself a full spring and summer 722 to become accustomed to the new world 723 and to do all the thing you had to do 724 before the winter set in 725 in fact of course they ended up leaving in september 726 which wa about a bad a it could be 727 on september 6 1620 fearfully late in the season 728 undersupplied and overcrowded 729 with autumn storm already whipping the north atlantic 730 into menacing furrow of white capped wave 731 the imayfloweri left plymouth harbor 732 and set out on her own across the atlantic 733 edward winslow a 24yearold printer 734 traveling with his wife elizabeth 735 never forgot the moment they set sail 736 wednesday the sixth of september 737 the wind coming east northeast a fine small gale 738 we loosed from plymouth having been kindly entertained 739 and courteously used by diver friend there dwelling 740 the imayfloweri lost sight of land end 741 sometime towards the end of the first week of september 742 it wa starting to gale 743 william bradford remembered her finally setting forth 744 under a prosperous wind 745 somewhere far out on the north atlantic 746 a the imayfloweri lay ahull in a furious storm 747 an indentured servant named john howland 748 climbed up on deck to get a breath of fresh air 749 and wa hurled violently overboard 750 when the ship rolled suddenly in the shifting gale 751 a he flew over the side 752 he grabbed blindly at a dangling halyard 753 and though he wa carried far beneath the wave 754 somehow held on long enough 755 for the crew to haul him back to safety 756 john howlands survival wa a fortuitous and random 757 a his near fatal plunge 758 in the new world he would thrive 759 work off his indenture become a cornerstone of the colony 760 and marry a pretty young woman named elizabeth tilley 761 she would bear him ten child 762 who would in turn produce 88 grandchild 763 from whom over the next four century 764 an estimated two million american would descend 765 including ralph waldo emerson joseph smith 766 franklin roosevelt humphrey bogart chevy chase 767 and both george bush father and son 768 when they finally set sail 769 theyre going against the prevailing westerly wind 770 theyre struggling against the gulf stream 771 and they made incredibly slow progress 772 two mile an hour across the atlantic 773 some of them tried to create little cabin within this 774 which just made these little suffocating cell 775 and chamber pot everywhere 776 there wa a boat that had been cut up into piece 777 that some people were trying to use for a bed 778 there were two dog a spaniel and a giant slobbery mastiff 779 and it is a voyage from hell 780 push 781 push 782 somewhere far out on the atlantic 783 stephen hopkins wife elizabeth 784 gave birth to a baby boy whom they named oceanus 785 they almost turned back 786 the sailor at one point 787 said theyd be happy to earn their wage 788 but theyre not going to risk their life 789 bradford spell it out 790 he describes it a awful 791 and these terrible sailor who were a blight on humanity 792 and the stranger some of whom were worse 793 loaded up with all this gear animal people 794 it amazing that they came out alive 795 and by the end of it people are getting sick 796 and so there wa a real sense of urgency aboard 797 particularly for master jones who knew at some point 798 he had to get these people off his ship 799 two people had died and more were failing fast 800 when early on the morning of thursday november 9 1620 801 after more than two month at sea 802 a crew member spied a line of high bluff 803 gleaming far off in the early dawn light 804 and shouted out excitedly to captain jones 805 it wa the first land they had seen in 65 day 806 but their jubilation quickly dimmed 807 a word raced through the ship that they had made landfall 808 far north of their intended destination 809 theyve arrived off the coast of cape cod 810 but theyre 200 mile off course 811 and so master jones head them south 812 towards the hudson river 813 and unfortunately there are no reliable chart 814 and they unsuspectingly find themselves 815 in one of the most dangerous piece of shoal water 816 on the atlantic coast 817 theyre in the midst of what bradford would call 818 roaring breaker 819 and it look like this is going to be the end of them 820 and jones make a very historic decision 821 he say were not going south 822 were going to take this breeze to the north 823 around the wrist of what they called cape cod 824 to whatever harbor is there 825 and im getting these people off my ship 826 on november 11 1620 they rounded the tip of cape cod 827 and sailed into the relative calm and safety 828 of the great bay 829 where even before they dropped anchor 830 long festering tension between the stranger and the pilgrim 831 broke out into the open 832 having landed so far north 833 of the boundary of their legal patent 834 many of the stranger insisted 835 they were now bound by nothing at all 836 and began to speak openly of splintering off 837 and going their own way once they came ashore 838 this day before we came to harbor 839 observing some not well affected to unity and concord 840 but gave some appearance of faction 841 it wa thought good there should be 842 an association and agreement 843 that we should combine together in one body 844 and submit to such government and governor 845 a we should by common consent agree to make and choose 846 and set our hand to this that follows word for word 847 william brewster in all likelihood 848 drafted the short agreement 849 little more than a single sentence long 850 stating that they agreed to combine themselves 851 together into a civil body politic 852 with the power to enact whatever law proved necessary 853 to preserve the group 854 the point of the compact wa to ward off the danger 855 of division and dissolution 856 after they got to the other side 857 the thing thats key about it is it a contract 858 it not exactly an elaborate plan for democracy 859 it a contract 860 were going to agree on this particular goal 861 and get everybodys name on this document 862 and make a commitment to this 863 on the morning of november 11 1620 864 the mayflower compact wa offered up for signature 865 the first to sign wa john carver 866 one of the wealthiest men on board 867 the last a servant named edward leister 868 in the end the vast majority of the men on board 869 put their name to the paper 41 adult men in all 870 90 percent of the adult male population of the imayfloweri 871 year later when william bradford and others 872 codified the rule of plymouth colony in a new book of law 873 on the very first page they described the compact a 874 a solemn and binding combination 875 whose authority came from the fact that 876 it wa based upon the vote of the governed 877 although the compact began 878 with an affirmation of loyalty to king james 879 the book of law made clear that at time of political crisis 880 the authority of the monarch could sometimes be suspended 881 while the consent of the governed could never be 882 once the signing wa complete 883 the colonist acted collectively for the first time 884 and elected john carver to be their governor 885 at least for the moment 886 from the relative safety of the ship at anchor in cape cod bay 887 the threat to the corporate integrity of the colony 888 had been averted 889 and against all odds 890 here they are off this very dangerous coast 891 knowing that there is this huge continent ahead of them 892 master jones could see something 893 that he could get his mind around 894 but for his passenger it wa very different 895 this wa an alien environment 896 it a if they have been set down on another planet 897 and there it is in all it mystery before them 898 being thus past the vast ocean and a sea of trouble 899 they had now no friend to welcome them 900 or inn to repair to 901 or to refresh their weatherbeaten body 902 no house much le town to repair to 903 to seek for succor 904 and for the season it wa winter 905 and they that know the winter of that country 906 know them to be sharp and harsh 907 subject to cruel and fierce storm 908 besides what could they see 909 but a hideous desolate wilderness 910 full of wild beast and wild men 911 on november 11 912 with their ship safely anchored off the tip of cape cod 913 a landing party of 16 armed men 914 including william bradford edward winslow 915 and the veteran english soldier they had hired mile standish 916 ventured ashore in a small boat and stepped on dry land 917 for the first time in two month 918 though they walked for hour amongst the windswept dune 919 before returning to the imayfloweri 920 with a boatload of freshly cut fire wood 921 on their first excursion ashore they found no wild beast 922 and stranger still 923 no sign of any human presence at all wild or otherwise 924 back on the ship a the sun went down 925 the enormity of their situation began to sink in upon them 926 there on the edge of the dark whispering continent 927 time seemed to stand still for the immigrant 928 then widen into an ominous void 929 for summer being done 930 all thing stand on them with a weather beaten face 931 a whole country full of wood and thicket 932 represented a wild and savage view 933 if they looked behind them 934 there wa the mighty ocean which they had passed 935 and wa now a a main bar and gulf to separate them 936 from all the civil part of the world 937 let it also be considered what weak hope 938 of supply and succor they left behind them 939 what could now sustain them 940 but the spirit of god and his grace 941 may not and ought not 942 the child of these father rightly say 943 our father were englishman 944 which come over this great ocean 945 and were ready to perish in this wilderness 946 but they cried unto the lord and he heard their voice 947 and looked on their adversity et cetera 948 let them therefore praise the lord 949 because he is good and his mercy endure forever 950 a little before the removal of that church of christ 951 from holland to plymouth in new england 952 about the year 1618 953 a the ancient indian report 954 there befell a great mortality among them 955 chiefly desolating those place 956 where the english afterward planted their colony 957 in southeastern massachusetts east of narragansett bay 958 thats wampanoag territory 959 in 1616 before the coming of the pilgrim 960 there wa a huge plague 961 it started in maine brought over by european fisherman 962 it swept a 15milewide path right down the coast 963 sort of took a left through the middle of wampanoag country 964 and stopped at narragansett bay 965 the wampanoag and i think any other group that it hit 966 suffered anywhere from a 50 to a 90 loss in population 967 it happened so quickly 968 the mean of death were so sudden and yet relentless 969 and english fisherman explorer come to the coast 970 and say it absolutely abandoned it devastated 971 where did the people go 972 and from that time to 1619 973 thats what they found emptiness 974 abandoned village bone scattered around the ground 975 the hand of god fell heavily upon them 976 with such a mortal stroke 977 that they died on heap a they lay in their house 978 the living being not able to bury the dead 979 they were left for crow kite and vermin to pray upon 980 in some of the account 981 they found just bone bleached 982 not because we didnt have ritual and observance 983 but because there wasnt anybody left 984 to take care of the one who had passed away 985 nowhere wa the devastation more complete 986 than in a village the wampanoag called patuxet 987 one villager named tisquantum 988 kidnapped two year before the plague began 989 and carried off in chain to europe 990 returned in 1619 to find his village completely abandoned 991 tisquantum wa fortunate 992 along with others who had been kidnapped 993 from wampanoag territory to make their way back home 994 only to find the devastation that ha occurred 995 patuxet is gone 996 it wa a village of about 2000 people 997 and when tisquantum came back not one had survived 998 no one 999 he wa the only survivor of his entire village 1000 it unimaginable the grief the loss of that 1001 and this is the world into which the pilgrim enter 1002 it very convenient for the telling of american history 1003 to start with the plague 1004 to start with this massive death 1005 but when those plague happen 1006 they are not a total a they appear 1007 there are some area that were virtually untouched 1008 by the plague 1009 it wa not so empty that it wa ready to be reoccupied 1010 by someone from across the ocean 1011 but when they arrived in this territory 1012 they believed that their journey wa ordained by god 1013 that they had a mission that they were to fulfill 1014 and the desolation that they found wa god providence 1015 it wa meant to be that way for them 1016 a tremendous amount of ideological work go on 1017 in english justification narrative saying 1018 the ground ha been cleared for u 1019 now that ground is waste and void 1020 god ha seen fit 1021 to clear the ground for our possession for our plantation 1022 they spent their first month tethered to the ship 1023 while three successive scouting party 1024 probed their way down the long arm of the cape 1025 towards the mainland looking for fresh water 1026 and a suitable place to settle for the winter 1027 on their first day out 1028 they caught sight of six men and a dog 1029 walking far down the beach 1030 the first native inhabitant they had seen 1031 the men stared back at them for a moment 1032 then whistled for the dog 1033 and disappeared into the line of tree 1034 a they moved 1035 through the strange and inscrutable landscape 1036 filled with sign of human presence 1037 they could see but not understand 1038 their first halting foray 1039 had a primal transgressive unsettling character to them 1040 in the first scouting mission 1041 they found a sand mound and started to dig it up 1042 and they realized this might be a grave 1043 so they stopped digging 1044 bradford doesnt report that in his history 1045 edward winslow doe 1046 what bradford report is coming on another place 1047 finding the same kind of mound digging it up 1048 and finding basket of corn 1049 they take away half the corn 1050 then what happens on the second scouting trip 1051 bradford doesnt report at all 1052 but winslow give u a long account 1053 of a smaller group 1054 going in through the wood to an indian village 1055 and finding something that look like a grave 1056 so they begin to dig and this time they continue 1057 they start taking out the good 1058 they start taking out the plank 1059 they start taking out the mat 1060 until they find two bundle one larger and one smaller 1061 they open up the first bundle and the first thing they notice 1062 is that it full of this fine red powder 1063 that ha a kind of smell 1064 they say it not a bad smell but the smell come up to them 1065 they look further in 1066 and they see the bone and skull of a man 1067 the face still ha skin clinging to it 1068 but whats most startling 1069 is that the skull is covered with blond hair 1070 so they know that this is not an indian 1071 but the body of a european 1072 they open up the second mat 1073 and the find the bone and the skull of a child 1074 and the child body is decorated 1075 with white indian bead and bracelet 1076 and there are little childish thing around 1077 so there this mystery 1078 what ha happened here 1079 who are these body 1080 what are they doing in the same grave 1081 what wa the relationship between these dead body 1082 and the living hand that put them there 1083 and they can not construct a narrative about that 1084 and this make them think of their own situation 1085 how will we die here 1086 whose hand will attend to u 1087 what will happen to u here 1088 they moved on 1089 a few night later at a place called first encounter beach 1090 they were attacked in the dark by a party of warrior 1091 for hour the air wa filled 1092 with war cry and whistling arrow 1093 which they answered with deafening blast of musket fire 1094 until the attacker withdrew 1095 thus it pleased god william bradford wrote 1096 to vanquish our enemy and give u deliverance 1097 finally on december 8 1098 on the far western shore of the bay 1099 they came upon a site 1100 they determined might suit them for a settlement 1101 it wa an indian settlement that had been abandoned 1102 it seemed physically speaking a proper place 1103 and it had a nice slope 1104 down to the harbor and field beyond 1105 and that seemed to be a convenient place 1106 and one of the sad tragic irony 1107 is that the place that the plymouth colonist 1108 settle on for their location 1109 is the village that wa perhaps the hardest hit 1110 of all the wampanoag village patuxet 1111 to the point where there are body lying on the ground 1112 that can not be buried because there are no relative 1113 and from a native perspective 1114 you would not reoccupy those place 1115 so people must have thought the pilgrim were insane 1116 to come and settle in a place 1117 where there been so much death and loss 1118 on december 12 the third and final scouting party 1119 sailed back across the bay to the waiting imayfloweri 1120 where william bradford wa greeted with staggering news 1121 five day earlier his 23yearold wife dorothy 1122 had somehow fallen overboard while the ship lay at anchor 1123 and drowned in the icy water of the bay 1124 the deck were icy 1125 she could have slipped overboard 1126 she could equally have been suffering from depression 1127 maybe it wa too much leaving her child behind 1128 maybe with the advanced scurvy 1129 which can give you the feeling of not just depression 1130 but of being doomed 1131 did she slip herself into the water 1132 and to this day people are wondering 1133 well wa it just an accident 1134 we have a tendency i think 1135 to think that people of this enormous religious belief 1136 would never take their life 1137 and thats not the case at all 1138 and the fact of the matter is despair wa a huge part 1139 of what all of them were feeling 1140 a child had just died the day before her death 1141 this is not in bradford history 1142 it difficult for u to imagine that his wife dy 1143 and that he cant narrate it 1144 but he ha this double job 1145 he ha to be true to the event but also bring them 1146 into a larger narrative of providence and care 1147 many of the thing that he doesnt tell 1148 simply dont fit into that design 1149 and i think that the death of his wife wa one of those 1150 he couldnt not honor it 1151 but there wa no way to honor it 1152 so it disappears from the history 1153 william bradford never spoke of dorothys death in his history 1154 and the circumstance were never explained 1155 late in life he penned the line of a simple poem 1156 faint not poor soul in god still trust 1157 fear not the thing thou suffer must 1158 for whom he love he doth chastise 1159 and then all tear wipe from their eye 1160 on friday december 15 1620 1161 with it cargo of sickened and seaweary passenger and crew 1162 the imayfloweri sailed west across the vast windswept bay 1163 towards the dark wintry shore that awaited them 1164 looking at this wilderness bradford wa very concerned 1165 with the curse that god laid down to his people 1166 when he took the promised land away from them 1167 the people had grown untrusting 1168 theyre mumbling theyre bitter 1169 they say they wished theyd stayed in egypt 1170 that this wa not the promised land 1171 that god did not protect them 1172 and god laid down a curse on those people and said 1173 your carcass will fall in this wilderness 1174 you will die in this wilderness 1175 and there your carcass will fall 1176 they will be wasted 1177 in a very short speech god repeat the curse five time 1178 so this idea of having a bad death in the wilderness 1179 is not only a material challenge 1180 but it also a spiritual nightmare 1181 because it ha to do with god taking the promised land away 1182 in retrospect it wa shocking how little they understood 1183 what actually lay before them 1184 how illequipped they were for the challenge they faced 1185 and how rapidly william bradford worst nightmare 1186 would begin to take material shape before their very eye 1187 they arrive just at the worst possible time 1188 winter is just coming in 1189 and it the end of december by the time they begin 1190 to start building house 1191 the imayfloweri had to anchor a mile offshore 1192 because the harbor at plymouth wasnt deep enough 1193 to let the ship right up 1194 so that they had to ferry 1195 the supply the good so slowly in from the imayfloweri 1196 everything wa wrong 1197 i mean they had to reach the shore by wading through 1198 icecold water to the shoreline 1199 and bradford say at one point with sleet beating at them 1200 they were covered with this ice glaze 1201 and they caught cold and they died 1202 friday the 22nd 1203 the storm still continued that we could not get aland 1204 nor they come to u aboard 1205 push push 1206 this morning goodwife allerton wa delivered of a son 1207 but dead born 1208 sunday the 24th our people on shore 1209 heard a cry of some savage which caused an alarm 1210 and to stand on their guard expecting an assault 1211 but all wa quiet 1212 it doesnt bear thinking about how difficult 1213 it must have been building their meetinghouse 1214 on what the rest of u would call christmas day 1215 and they managed to build only very few house 1216 far fewer than theyd anticipated 1217 they had just set to work building a 21squarefoot 1218 common house for protection against indian attack 1219 when the temperature dropped 1220 and the weather closed in mercilessly 1221 one by one the weakened immigrant began to succumb 1222 to dysentery pneumonia tuberculosis exposure 1223 that first sickness that general mortality 1224 must have been so pervasive 1225 at one time in that first winter 1226 two or three people were dying every day 1227 the number of people who were sick and needed caring for 1228 it must have been overwhelming 1229 i think there is something particularly devastating 1230 about what happens to them that first winter 1231 by february people were dying in drove 1232 some huddled in the makeshift settlement 1233 many more back on the imayfloweri which had been converted 1234 to a hospital for the sick and a hospice for the dying 1235 the condition onboard that ship must have been absolutely awful 1236 they cant go ashore 1237 theyre all suffering from scurvy 1238 that sweet ship the imayfloweri 1239 by the end it wa like a death house on the water 1240 my god my god 1241 why hast thou forsaken me 1242 why art thou so far from helping me 1243 and from the word of my roaring 1244 o my god i cry in the day time 1245 it pleased god to visit u then with death daily 1246 and with so general a disease 1247 that the living were scarce able to bury the dead 1248 and the well in no measure sufficient to tend the sick 1249 by the spring half of them are dead 1250 50some people die that first year 1251 and by all right they all should have died 1252 given how illprepared they were 1253 of 18 couple that came over only three remained intact 1254 everywhere you have widow and widower and orphan 1255 and servant who came alone and died alone 1256 so there no one who is not grieving 1257 who is not mourning someone 1258 what happened that first winter 1259 wa more than most of the grieving survivor could bear 1260 the full horror of what they went through 1261 wa fated to live on only in the margin of history 1262 in bradford history he really turn away 1263 from the corps 1264 there no record of burial which with mass mortality 1265 with the dead outnumbering the living 1266 would account for a major activity of the group 1267 so the question becomes what happened to the dead 1268 and what we do know is hidden in a piece of court testimony 1269 by a man named phineas pratt 1270 he came in 1623 to find the plymouth colony 1271 completely devastated 1272 and he asks where are the rest of our friend 1273 and the answer he report is god took them away by death 1274 and we were so dejected and so frightened that first winter 1275 that those who could carried our sick men into the wood 1276 and propped them up against tree 1277 with their musket by their side so that the indian 1278 looking in through the forest would think that we had a guard 1279 a forest sentinel 1280 so the well bradford tell u are nursing the sick 1281 but what phineas pratt tell u is those who have strength 1282 are carrying sick and dying body into the wood 1283 and propping them up against tree 1284 later when increase mather is writing a history of plymouth 1285 he quote phineas pratt 1286 but right at that terribly transgressive moment 1287 mather change the story and insert instead 1288 that they buried their dead at night 1289 so a to keep their loss from the indian 1290 and then a the story of the pilgrim dead 1291 get told and retold then the story of night burial 1292 start to get remembered and cherished and elaborated 1293 and it come to be not only that they do night burial 1294 but that they plant corn over the graf so that the indian 1295 dont notice how many loss that they have 1296 but what really happened 1297 get completely dropped out of the history 1298 it is too transgressive and very dangerous 1299 a the story about the corps falling in the wilderness 1300 come to pas 1301 and this place becomes this place of death 1302 both native and english and so they had to make 1303 some kind of meaning out of that 1304 it couldnt just be a waste yard of bone for everyone 1305 they have to mean differently 1306 so they started to assign different meaning 1307 to indian death and english death 1308 indian death were just bone scattered on the ground 1309 were forgotten people were just material 1310 indian death wa about becoming carrion waste 1311 dispossession 1312 whereas english death wa about becoming the seed buried 1313 possession 1314 english death wa going to be remembered 1315 wa going to be honored 1316 and bradford make very much of this 1317 because in his history 1318 what he ha to do is plant those people in plymouth 1319 to make a kind of permanence there 1320 to claim that ground a a ground of history 1321 so putting body into the ground 1322 even though theyre scarce buried 1323 is a way of making that ground sacred 1324 it could be that the most important thing 1325 that the people of plymouth planted wa their dead 1326 the day were growing longer 1327 and the death rate had finally begun to subside 1328 when on friday march 16 1329 cry of panic and alarm rang out a a lone warrior 1330 naked except for a loin cloth and carrying a bow 1331 broke cover from the line of tree near their hut 1332 and walked boldly into the camp 1333 he saluted u in english and bade u welcome 1334 he wa the first savage we had met withal 1335 he said his name wa samoset 1336 he told u the place we now live is called patuxet 1337 and that about four year ago 1338 all the inhabitant died of an extraordinary plague 1339 so a there is none to hinder our possession 1340 or to lay claim unto it 1341 the wampanoag are looking for an ally 1342 theyre suspicious of the pilgrim when they first come 1343 they stay away from them at first they watch them 1344 but eventually they realize that an alliance 1345 is going to be best for them a well 1346 because theyre being dominated by other indian tribe 1347 who are not affected by the epidemic 1348 who are forcing them to pay tribute 1349 it wa not just a political convenience it wa survival 1350 if you do not have power backing you 1351 and you are a weakened people then the enemy 1352 that naturally exist around you will take advantage 1353 and our leadership knew very well 1354 the tough decision that needed to be made at the time 1355 in order to ensure 1356 that wampanoag people continued to exist in wampanoag territory 1357 six day later the emissary returned 1358 bringing the principle leader of the wampanoag their massasoit 1359 and 60 of his men including tisquantum 1360 the sole survivor of patuxet who served a interpreter 1361 a the two side concluded a remarkable treaty 1362 agreeing among other thing not to harm each others people 1363 and to come to each others aid in the event of attack 1364 it wa also agreed that tisquantum would remain 1365 with the struggling group on the site of his former home 1366 to help with the spring planting 1367 both people were in a survival situation 1368 the wampanoag had been devastated by disease 1369 in the three year before and the neighboring narragansetts 1370 were threatening to really take them over 1371 the pilgrim were obviously very close to losing everything 1372 after that first winter 1373 and i think there wa a recognition that they both 1374 needed each other 1375 not that they understood each other terribly well 1376 but they were desperate they were both desperate 1377 the pilgrim particularly so 1378 and so they began to form an alliance with massasoit 1379 and the wampanoag 1380 and i think that defined so much of what happened 1381 in that first and second year 1382 two week after concluding the treaty 1383 the immigrant gathered at the harbor 1384 to bid a somber farewell to the imayfloweri 1385 which on april 5 1621 set sail for england 1386 with captain jones an empty hold 1387 and a drastically diminished crew 1388 it wa one of the last voyage she would ever take 1389 in le than a year captain jones himself would be dead 1390 and two year after that the imayfloweri 1391 rotting at anchor on the thames would be sold for scrap 1392 and disappear to history 1393 the pilgrim only anchor and lifeline wa gone 1394 they were on their own 1395 with the return of warm weather they put in their first crop 1396 under tisquantums careful supervision 1397 planting herring in yardwide mound of earth 1398 sewn with corn seed and adding once the corn came up 1399 seed of squash and bean 1400 the coming of spring did not entirely halt 1401 the sad toll of death 1402 in this month of april whilst they were busy about their seed 1403 their governor mr john carver came out of the field very sick 1404 it being a hot day he complained greatly of his head 1405 and lay down and within a few hour his sens failed 1406 so a he never spake more till he died 1407 shortly after william bradford wa chosen governor 1408 in his stead 1409 and by renewed election every year 1410 continued sundry year together which i here note once for all 1411 all through the warm summer month the grieving immigrant 1412 labored to make a world for themselves building house 1413 tilling soil fishing for cod and bass in the bay 1414 in june they made their first tentative effort 1415 to trade with the native group around them 1416 in july william bradford sent edward winslow 1417 and stephen hopkins to visit the wampanoag in their village 1418 40 mile to the west to build on their alliance 1419 and to find out whom they had stolen corn seed from 1420 the previous december and to make reparation 1421 autumn came and the day dipped down into darkness 1422 by october they had finished erecting 11 crude structure 1423 in all seven dwelling house and four common building 1424 they had also managed to bring in a successful harvest of corn 1425 thanks to tisquantum and a the leaf began to turn 1426 they prepared edward winslow reported 1427 to in a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered 1428 the fruit of our labor 1429 no one at the time called it thanksgiving 1430 william bradford made no mention of it in his history 1431 there isnt much of a record 1432 there a paragraph i think in winslow that describes 1433 whats come to be known a the first thanksgiving 1434 it say nothing about an invitation 1435 it just that the english were doing this thing 1436 and massasoit showed up with these 90 men 1437 they stayed for three day they went out and got five deer 1438 to add to what the english were cooking 1439 they played game together 1440 there like four little fact of what happened 1441 and then the rest of it is fluff thats been added 1442 over the century 1443 twoandahalf century later at another american moment 1444 of great trial and suffering the humble event 1445 all but disregarded by the pilgrim themselves 1446 would be recast a one of the most important 1447 and defining moment in american history 1448 we love the story of thanksgiving 1449 because it about alliance and abundance and envisioning 1450 a future where native american and colonial american 1451 can come together and celebrate the providence of a single god 1452 but part of the reason that they were grateful 1453 wa that they had been in such misery 1454 that they had lost so many people 1455 on both side 1456 so in some way that day of thanksgiving 1457 is also coming out of mourning it also coming out of grief 1458 and this abundance that is a relief from that loss 1459 but we dont think about the loss 1460 we think about the abundance 1461 on november 9 1621 a shout went up from a lookout 1462 on burial hill followed by the loud booming of a cannon 1463 a far out in the bay the first sail they had seen 1464 since the departure of the imayfloweri 1465 loomed on the eastern horizon 1466 they had had no contact with the outside world 1467 for more than a year 1468 though they feared at first it might be french pirate 1469 it turned out to be an english relief ship called the ifortunei 1470 sent by their mercurial broker thomas weston 1471 a third the size of the imayfloweri 1472 the tiny vessel carried 35 new recruit 1473 to bradford dismay only a handful of them separatist 1474 no supply to speak of more mouth to feed 1475 just a winter came on again 1476 and a stinging letter from thomas weston himself 1477 rebuking the colonist for having failed to send back 1478 any cargo with the imayfloweri 1479 when the ifortunei weighed anchor four week later 1480 they freighted it with a much beaver fur 1481 and timber a they could muster but it wa nowhere near enough 1482 to make a difference 1483 they desperately needed to find something they could ship back 1484 to england to pay their debt 1485 and that just wasnt available 1486 in those early year in new england 1487 so there were all kind of challenge 1488 which they were not well prepared for 1489 over the next 18 month a the pilgrim struggled 1490 to stay alive and keep their group together 1491 they would face staggering new challenge 1492 on not one but three front simultaneously 1493 economic and demographic 1494 a they struggled desperately to make end meet 1495 and to contend with the influx of what william bradford called 1496 profane and disorderly outsider but also military 1497 a it soon became terrifying clear that their alliance 1498 with the wampanoag would not be easily replicated 1499 with other group in the region 1500 the struggle with those challenge 1501 would change them forever 1502 part of that ha to do with living in a world 1503 where it suddenly seems that no hold are barred 1504 where youre being forced to do thing that you never thought 1505 that you would be forced to do and youre willing to do thing 1506 that you never thought that you would be willing to do 1507 ominous rumor had been swirling around the settlement 1508 for month first that the narragansetts 1509 then that the massachusetts were planning to attack 1510 when in early december william bradford ordered 1511 the construction of an eightfoothigh timber wall 1512 around the entire plantation for protection 1513 work on the massive fortification 1514 had just been completed when three new ship 1515 also sent by thomas weston appeared in the harbor 1516 their arrival would trigger the darkest crisis 1517 in the pilgrim history 1518 thomas weston sponsored another competing trading post 1519 north of plymouth 1520 it wa very different from the pilgrim contingent 1521 they were not there for religious reason 1522 they did not have a social cohesion 1523 they did not have family structure 1524 they were there for financial reason 1525 and it wa a collection of young men 1526 none of the 60 new colonist were separatist 1527 they had come to set up 1528 what amounted to a rival trading post 1529 and after four month of uneasy cohabitation 1530 with the colonist at plymouth moved 30 mile up the coast 1531 to a place called wessagussett near a massachusetts village 1532 still reeling from the recent epidemic 1533 and thing very very quickly start deteriorating there 1534 they have terrible relationship with the native 1535 they run out of food 1536 the native start jeering at them making fun of them 1537 the people at wessagusset start trading their clothes 1538 for capful of corn they start working for the indian 1539 and the whole social structure of that trading post 1540 just absolutely fall apart 1541 a the new colony disintegrated more bad news reached plymouth 1542 first that the ifortunei had been plundered on her return voyage 1543 leaving the colony for a second straight year 1544 with nothing to show for itself 1545 then that a massive indian uprising in virginia 1546 had killed 347 english colonist near jamestown 1547 and the pilgrim feared that something similar 1548 wa about to happen to them 1549 and there were clear indication that they were under threat 1550 from some part of the local native american population 1551 in march 1623 news reached plymouth that massasoit himself 1552 their only ally lay dying and william bradford 1553 quickly dispatched edward winslow to his bedside 1554 under the englishman skilled care 1555 the wampanoag leader made a rapid recovery 1556 and in return revealed 1557 that plymouth wa in the gravest danger 1558 from a regionwide conspiracy whose aim wa to eradicate 1559 all english settlement in new england 1560 the massachusetts have a plan that they want to wipe out 1561 the wessagusset trading post 1562 but theyre afraid of retaliation from plymouth 1563 so the plan is to actually make a coalition 1564 and wipe out both wessagusset and plymouth 1565 confirmation came in midmarch 1566 when a colonist from wessagussett 1567 phineas pratt escaped from the dying settlement 1568 and somehow made his way overland to plymouth 1569 pursued all the way by a massachusetts warrior 1570 who wa captured by the pilgrim before he could kill him 1571 and imprisoned in the fort 1572 phineas pratt come to plymouth and tell plymouth 1573 whats happening at wessagusset 1574 and say there a dead man on my right hand 1575 there a dead man on my left hand 1576 im crawling over corps to get to you 1577 im being pursued by an indian 1578 but i have to come and tell you this 1579 mr weston colony had by their evil and debauched carriage 1580 so exasperated the indian among them a they plotted 1581 their overthrow 1582 and because they knew not how to effect it 1583 for fear we would revenge it upon them 1584 they secretly instigated other people to conspire 1585 against u also thinking to assault u 1586 with their force at home 1587 but their treachery wa discovered unto u 1588 and we went to rescue the life of our countryman 1589 and also to take vengeance of them for their villainy 1590 mile standish and allerton and bradford 1591 decide to make a preemptive strike 1592 mile standish and others go to wessagusset 1593 on the pretense of trade 1594 and they gather many of the indian men 1595 including two leader 1596 into the trading post supposedly for trade 1597 lock the door and on a signal kill these two men 1598 with their own knife hanging around their neck 1599 standish wa a war veteran 1600 and the veteran of the thirty year war 1601 were brute hammerers 1602 and they went up there a young indian boy they hung 1603 and then the rest they stabbed to death 1604 and cut off one of their head and brought it back 1605 and put it on a pole in the middle of plymouth 1606 mile standish decapitates one of them and brings the head 1607 a a trophy back to plymouth where he is greeted with joy 1608 this is wituwamat 1609 the head is then erected on a pike 1610 and placed at the apex of their fort 1611 and it stay there for year 1612 by the good providence of god 1613 we killed seven of the chief of them 1614 and the head of one of them stand still upon our fort 1615 for a terror unto others 1616 when word of the attack reached leiden john robinson 1617 wrote an anguished letter back to william bradford 1618 concerning the killing of those poor indian 1619 oh 1620 how happy a thing had it been if you had converted some 1621 before you had killed any 1622 besides where blood is once begun to be shed 1623 it is seldom stanched of a long time after 1624 you will say they deserved it 1625 but upon what provocation by those heathenish christian 1626 it is also a thing more glorious in men eye 1627 than pleasing in god to be a terror to poor barbarous people 1628 yours truly loving john robinson 1629 the bloodshed at wessagussett wa a watershed 1630 permanently altering the balance of power in the region 1631 in favor of the pilgrim and their ally the wampanoag 1632 five month later william bradford married 1633 a recently arrived 32yearold widow named alice southworth 1634 in a ceremony attended by the entire community 1635 the pilgrim usually shun decoration ornamentation 1636 but when bradford get married 1637 people notice one piece of ornament 1638 a piece of linen soaked in wituwamats blood 1639 visitor to plymouth commented upon it 1640 it there in letter 1641 when massasoit come with his band to bradford wedding 1642 he see wituwamats head on the pike 1643 although to massasoit it wa a signal of the strength 1644 of his alliance with plymouth and plymouth willingness 1645 to take action against enemy 1646 separatism wa not a simple thing 1647 and being a pilgrim wa not a simple thing 1648 there wa a kind of dilemma at the heart of it 1649 both in england and even more so 1650 in the plymouth colony in america 1651 and i think the problem wa this 1652 on the one hand separatism wa an individualistic 1653 libertarian kind of a creed in the sense that it encouraged 1654 ordinary people to read the bible for themselves 1655 and to put together their own religious community 1656 gathering together independently in a new space 1657 if you like 1658 but the difficulty with that wa of course 1659 once you had established that a your creed 1660 then what wa to prevent the separatist congregation 1661 splitting into all sort of different smaller sect 1662 once youd started down that path of independence 1663 once youd started looking for liberty looking for freedom 1664 how could you stop it 1665 by 1623 the most immediate existential threat 1666 to the colony survival had started to recede 1667 but other challenge remained and in the long run 1668 these would prove even more intractable 1669 there a sense that they came to america 1670 in search of religious freedom 1671 they didnt 1672 they came to worship god the way they saw wa the right way 1673 and when others came looking for that kind of freedom 1674 they did everything they could to stop that 1675 they did not believe in that kind of diversity of practice 1676 they believed in protection 1677 they believed in boundarykeeping 1678 they believed in the expulsion of contaminant 1679 they believed in freedom for themselves 1680 when you trace bradford thinking through these year 1681 what strike me most is the degree to which 1682 it wa a continuous disappointment 1683 they wanted just to have group of true believer 1684 they wanted to live together in a pure form and unattached 1685 because they thought 1686 and bradford is quite clear on this 1687 thats how the first church wa 1688 but by 1625 which is what 1689 just a few year from the beginning 1690 he already complaining that the group is dissipating 1691 that there are trouble 1692 that stranger and gentile of all sort are making trouble 1693 in 1626 a gloom fell over the settlement 1694 when news came from leiden that john robinson had died 1695 the previous winter 1696 and i think that wa a perpetual disappointment 1697 to brewster and to bradford 1698 they felt the pain of that very clearly 1699 that this person who wa 1700 the most crucial mentor for the whole group 1701 so instrumental in creating this community 1702 wa never there with them 1703 in term of the survival of plymouth colony 1704 the actual lowest point wa in 1625 and 1626 1705 they still had these enormous debt in england 1706 which they couldnt repay 1707 they still hadnt found enough beaver skin 1708 or enough by way of anything else 1709 to be able to ship it back to england for money 1710 and their investment backer in england 1711 were extremely unhappy with the situation 1712 and there wa a strong possibility 1713 that they might have decided simply to go south 1714 to jamestown 1715 so that wa really the dangerous moment 1716 in 1626 the investor in london 1717 convinced the colony would never show a profit 1718 filed for bankruptcy 1719 and disbanded the merchant adventurer 1720 most of the massive debt left behind wa assumed 1721 by eight of the colony most stalwart member 1722 who going forward would have a monopoly 1723 on whatever trade the company might be able to establish 1724 a prospect that by 1626 looked exceedingly bleak 1725 a most people on both side of the atlantic 1726 now assumed the blighted colony would soon fail completely 1727 but it didnt 1728 their business model leaned heavily on the idea that america 1729 wa a place of thing of incredible value 1730 now beaver are not quite a valuable a gold 1731 but it is still a valuable commodity 1732 so the business model in some sense is almost utopian 1733 but there wa a kernel of truth to it 1734 and that end up saving them 1735 the demand for beaver skin arose entirely 1736 from the demand for beaver hat 1737 now the pilgrim certainly did try to find beaver skin 1738 a soon a they could 1739 but although beaver skin were valuable 1740 the price wa relatively low during the early 1620s 1741 it rocketed up later on in 1627 1628 because england 1742 found itself at war with france and spain 1743 and beaver fur became more scarce in europe 1744 and so the price went up dramatically 1745 it quadrupled and the pilgrim got the benefit of that 1746 but in order to really get fur in sufficient quantity 1747 they needed to get up to maine to the kennebec valley in maine 1748 or the penobscot valley in maine 1749 river valley where there are enormous supply of beaver fur 1750 readily available 1751 edward winslow wa the key character in this 1752 because winslow had been going up to maine for several year 1753 prospecting if you like for beaver fur in the area 1754 so everything came together in 1627 and 1628 1755 the price had gone up pilgrim had found the fur 1756 the opportunity presented itself 1757 and back came beaver skin in their thousand 1758 now once the pilgrim had been able to deliver beaver skin 1759 back to england in sufficient quantity to turn a profit 1760 investor in london saw that if you took this business model 1761 the pilgrim had developed then you might be able to build 1762 a much much bigger colony with not hundred of colonist 1763 but thousand of colonist 1764 and so they took the plymouth colony prototype 1765 and they turned it into something far far bigger 1766 on a far bigger scale 1767 which is where you find yourself with the founding 1768 of new boston in 1630 1769 theyre definitely the shock troop 1770 that make it seem possible to come into a northern climate 1771 and make it pay 1772 and support a fairly large european population 1773 in the spring of 1630 a ship called the iarabellai 1774 the first of a massive fleet of 17 ship 1775 led by a wealthy puritan lawyer named john winthrop 1776 left yarmouth for the bay of massachusetts 1777 60 mile north of plymouth 1778 bringing 1000 wellsupplied puritan immigrant 1779 all through the spring and summer the great ship arrived 1780 by the end of july a church had been established 1781 the first church of boston 1782 by midseptember 1783 the new settlement already had a population of nearly 1000 1784 three time larger in ten week than the tiny community plymouth 1785 had gathered to itself in ten year 1786 the size of the two group is massively different 1787 the ethos is similar they are all reformed protestant 1788 of a passionate conviction 1789 but the striking difference is the people who go to boston 1790 make an enormous fuss about the fact that 1791 they are not separating from the church of england 1792 in july edward winslow paid a visit 1793 to their new sister colony 1794 whatever their theological difference he reported 1795 william bradford could take courage in knowing that 1796 the elder of the new colony had been urged 1797 to take advice of them at plymouth 1798 and to do nothing to offend them 1799 after ten harrowing year the future of a puritan new england 1800 if not a separatist one seemed assured 1801 the pilgrim experiment in that respect at least 1802 had worked 1803 thus out of small beginning greater thing 1804 have been produced by his hand that made all thing of nothing 1805 and give being to all thing that are 1806 and a one small candle may light a thousand 1807 so the light here kindled hath shone to many 1808 yea in some sort to our whole nation 1809 let the glorious name of jehovah have all the praise 1810 well in some way of course it is a success story 1811 because completely against the odds they survived 1812 they put down root they established a colony 1813 so in that sense it wa a success 1814 the sense in which it is poignantly not a success is 1815 i think for bradford the sense that the community 1816 he had hoped for didnt materialize in the sweet way 1817 that he had hoped it would 1818 and thats partly due to john robinson not coming over 1819 and there being a lack of an effective ministry 1820 they were looking for their pastor 1821 their pastor never came 1822 i think we have a tendency to think 1823 oh what a great success plymouth colony 1824 ultimately ended up being 1825 and how proud those first comer 1826 a they called themselves must have been 1827 but they wanted to achieve 1828 the ultimate spiritual community on earth 1829 and that never happened 1830 in 1630 not long after the founding 1831 of the colony at boston william bradford 1832 40 now and beginning his tenth year a governor 1833 sat down to write a history of plymouth plantation 1834 sensing perhaps from the moment the new settlement began 1835 how dramatically his own community would be transformed 1836 and determined to leave an account of who his people were 1837 and what had happened to them and why they mattered 1838 i think for bradford the experiment wa not a success 1839 but a a historian writing for posterity 1840 he can tell the story and preserve the meaning 1841 of their vision and their implantation 1842 even a that vision is being dissipated 1843 and not being held by others he can preserve it in his history 1844 he wa aware of what wa going on around him 1845 acutely aware of thing that were happening 1846 and he wa no fool 1847 he knew that when the puritan started to arrive in 1630 1848 15000 of them the market for agricultural good 1849 wa going to boom 1850 which meant more farm farther out fresher ground 1851 that would further dissipate the religious group 1852 and even those most committed to it principle 1853 are wandering out into farm and outlying district 1854 the heart of the community wa being lost 1855 because it integrity wa personal 1856 people living together a a group praying together 1857 and sharing their belief 1858 and this is a great despair for bradford 1859 theyve gone through all of this hell to create 1860 this wonderful exceptional community of saint 1861 but it doesnt happen 1862 it just fragment and blow apart 1863 instead of his little congregation of saint 1864 he ha his best friend edward winslow moving off 1865 forming other town such a duxbury 1866 leaving the mother church 1867 oh poor plymouth how dost thou moan 1868 thy child all from thee are gone 1869 and left thou art in widow state 1870 poor helpless sad and desolate 1871 some thou hast had it is well known 1872 who sought thy good before their own 1873 but time have changed those day are gone 1874 and therefore thou art left alone 1875 to make others rich thyself are poor 1876 they are increased out of thy store 1877 but being rich they thee forsake 1878 leaving thee poor and desolate 1879 one by one the first comer who had meant so much to him 1880 moved on or moved off or died away 1881 william brewster in 1644 1882 edward winslow in 1655 1883 mile standish in 1656 1884 i wonder with bradford 1885 he ha had to deal with so much human frailty 1886 so many human foible in his life a governor 1887 that perhaps the sense of being a pilgrim bound for heaven 1888 rather than a pilgrim who will reach 1889 their new jerusalem on earth is borne in on him 1890 very strongly towards the end of his life 1891 i think there may be something of that verse from hebrew 11 1892 we are pilgrim and stranger in the world 1893 come to his heart 1894 and at the end of his life in what to me is especially moving 1895 he turned to hebrew he learned hebrew 1896 he thought hed get closer to god in conversation 1897 with the sacred script 1898 anything to deepen his understanding 1899 of what wa happening 1900 though i am grown aged yet i have had a longing desire 1901 to see with my own eye 1902 something of that most ancient language and holy tongue 1903 in which the law and oracle of god were writ 1904 and in which god and angel 1905 spake to the holy patriarch of old time 1906 and what name were given to thing from the creation 1907 and though i can not attain to much herein 1908 yet i am refreshed to have seen some glimpse here of 1909 a moses saw the land of canaan from afar off 1910 my aim and desire is to see how the word and phrase 1911 lie in the holy text 1912 and to discern somewhat of the same for my own content 1913 he died on may 9 1657 1914 having outlived all his contemporary 1915 and having served a governor for 31 of the 37 year 1916 he had lived in the new world 1917 lamented his first biographer 1918 cotton mather later said by all the colony of new england 1919 a a common blessing and father to them all 1920 he wa 67 year old 1921 his body wa buried on the summit of burial hill 1922 near the grave of his mentor william brewster 1923 and in sight of the sand hill of cape cod 1924 in the year to come the world his people had come to 1925 in search of a new jerusalem would be transformed utterly 1926 with shocking rapidity and the pilgrim experience 1927 itself all but carried under and forgotten 1928 within 15 year of his death 1929 there were 70000 english settler in 110 town 1930 along the new england coast 1931 and fewer than 20000 native american left 1932 in half a dozen tribe and only at most 1000 wampanoag 1933 in 1675 massasoit own son metacom 1934 called phillip by the settler 1935 helped lead a desperate last ditch effort 1936 to drive the english colonist from their territory 1937 before their world wa obliterated completely 1938 in the aftermath of king philip war 1939 a day of thanksgiving wa declared to celebrate 1940 that king philip wa now dead and his head wa stuck 1941 on a pole in the middle of plymouth 1942 which i think is why native people instituted 1943 a day of mourning at thanksgiving 1944 because had the plymouth colonist not survived 1945 later colonization might not have happened 1946 without those coastal settlement 1947 that created a toehold and dug in 1948 and once they were there it wa impossible to extricate them 1949 a time went on the manuscript william bradford 1950 had left to his son and heir on his deathbed 1951 wa carefully handed down in the family 1952 from one generation to the next 1953 until a century after his death it found it way 1954 into the library of the old south church in boston 1955 it wa still there in 1767 when the last royal governor 1956 of the colony thomas hutchinson 1957 consulted it for a history he wa writing after which 1958 the revolution came 1959 and the manuscript vanished into thin air 1960 and so bradford book wa lost 1961 it wa taken from there in 1777 by the british 1962 during the revolutionary war 1963 and people tried to recover it people tried to find it 1964 people tried to trace it 1965 and nobody knew what had happened to their history 1966 their great gospel of the founding of the nation 1967 for 80 year following independence 1968 the missing bradford text wa lamented 1969 by scholar in the north 1970 a the shadow of american history lengthened 1971 and a a bitter sectional dispute 1972 between north and south intensified 1973 fought in part over whether the nation deepest root 1974 lay in slaveholding virginia or puritan new england 1975 there this tremendous battle in the 19th century 1976 between new england historian and virginia historian 1977 about which is the first american settlement 1978 jamestown or plymouth 1979 all hope of the book recovery had been lost 1980 when in 1855 a scholar browsing in a bookstore in boston 1981 chanced upon a recently published english history 1982 of the anglican church in america 1983 and his eye fell on an unmistakable quotation 1984 from the missing bradford journal 1985 excited inquiry revealed that the long lost manuscript 1986 had somehow found it way no one knew how 1987 into the library of the bishop of london at fulham palace 1988 the bishop refused to surrender the manuscript 1989 but consented to have a handwritten copy made 1990 and sent back to boston where it wa published in 1856 1991 spawning a prewar pilgrim craze across the north 1992 on the eve of the bloodiest war in american history 1993 in the midst of which a the death toll mounted 1994 abraham lincoln established the last thursday in november 1995 a a national day of thanksgiving 1996 in honor of the pilgrim father and by the end of which 1997 the pilgrim narrative had been officially anointed 1998 a the true founding moment of america 1999 eventually they petitioned to bring the book back to america 2000 that petition wa granted 2001 and when the text itself returned 2002 it wa a scriptural event 2003 and it came back with such ceremony and such gratitude 2004 and such honor that the history wa coming home again 2005 so it wa another kind of plantation 2006 it wa reimplanting that first history back in it home 2007 and nationalizing that story 2008 in the spring of 1897 2009 the little manuscript bound in brittle vellum 2010 wa finally brought home again 2011 for the first time in 120 year 2012 and installed with great fanfare 2013 in the statehouse of the commonwealth of massachusetts 2014 in boston in a ceremony attended by dozen 2015 of prominent politician and dignitary 2016 in a long and rousing keynote speech 2017 senator george hoare extolled william bradford journal 2018 a a work unequaled in the annals of human history 2019 since the story of bethlehem 2020 and his final word ringing through the statehouse 2021 brought the packed assembly to it foot 2022 massachusetts he called out will preserve it until the time 2023 shall come that her child are unworthy of it 2024 and that time shall come never 2025 the pilgrim story wa complete 2026 the journey wa over and the pilgrim themselves 2027 250 year on had prevailed 2028 somewhere william bradford might have smiled 2029 but them a place did god provide 2030 in wilderness and did them guide 2031 unto the american shore 2032 where they made way for many more 2033 they broke the ice themselves alone 2034 and so became a stepping stone 2035 for all others who in like case 2036 were glad to find a resting place 2036 please rate

having received the promise 15 but having seen them afar off 16 and being persuaded of them and embracing them 17 and confessing that they were but stranger 18 and pilgrim on the earth 19 for they that say such thing declare plainly 20 that they seek another country 21 and truly if they had been mindful of that country 22 from whence they came out 23 they might have had opportunity to return 24

were woman 83 including three expectant mother 84 by the time they set sail in the fall of 1620 85 england had still not succeeded in establishing 86 a truly viable colony on the shore of the new world 87 and their chance of survival let alone success 88 were all but nil 89 sue allan when you look at jamestown in virginia by 1620 90 theyd pumped in something like 8000 colonist there 91 and yet they were struggling to keep their number above 1000 92 the death rate wa awful so it wa a very dangerous step 93 to even contemplate 94 especially given the number of people on the imayfloweri 95 jill lepore they dont register at all numerically 96 it a tiny handful of people many of whom dont survive 97 were thinking about migration to the america 98 in the 17th and 18th century 99 were talking about ten million african for instance 100 a against this tiny handful of englishman and woman 101 the fascinating thing then about the pilgrim story 102 is how this tiny group of people managed to get by 103 and managed to tell the story in such a way 104 a to erase that whole other history 105 kathleen donegan if you ask people 106 where doe america start 107 theyll say it start at plymouth rock 108 despite the fact that jamestown wa founded in 1607 109 and plymouth wa founded in 1620 110 it became our story of national origin 111 narrator somehow with the passage of time 112 the arrival of this frail unlikely band 113 would come to be seen a the true founding moment of america 114 and the story of their coming enshrined 115 a the quintessential myth of american origin 116 commemorated each year 117 on the fourth thursday in november at thanksgiving 118 and embodied in a handful 119 of iconic and instantly recognizable image 120 including a rock and a ship 121 and a feast that almost certainly never took place 122 a we imagine it did 123 nathaniel philbrick i think we feel that were such a new country 124 that we need to know how it all began 125 we need that beginning moment 126 and the pilgrim serve that purpose 127 but what people forget is that it wasnt all fated 128 these were normal people under extraordinary circumstance 129 and they were making it up a they went along 130 and it end up being a much a story of survival 131 a it is a story of origin 132 narrator what no one could have imagined in the fall of 1620 133 a autumn wind blew the 102 passenger of the imayfloweri 134 west across the atlantic 135 wa how harrowing dark and deeply unsettling 136 their pilgrimage to the new world would be 137 or how utterly their quest for a godly republic 138 would transform the world they were sailing towards 139 the searcher themselves 140 and the nation that would rise up 141 long after they were gone consecrated to their memory 142 donegan because the pilgrim have been so enshrined 143 in the national imagination because theyve meant so much 144 in what weve told ourselves about who we are a american 145 we need to go back and ask question 146 about why we picked that story 147 what it wa about these people what it wa about their history 148 that we wanted to see reflected in our own national image 149 there been a tremendous amount of memory produced 150 around the pilgrim 151 but there also been a lot of forgetting 152 you know that memory is very selective 153 and so to look at whats been remembered 154 and let that shed light on whats been forgotten 155 is an important exercise 156 when were thinking about something 157 that ha been so central to our national imagination 158 bird chirping 159 bernard bailyn the difference is bradford 160 not simply because he wa the governor 161 for many many year 162 but because of his personal quality 163 he wa a person of very delicate sensibility 164 and very keen perception 165 and he watched the fluttering of their little conventicle 166 and it ups and down with the greatest concern 167 and registered it in this wonderful prose 168 narrator to a remarkable degree 169 we would scarcely remember the pilgrim at all 170 and certainly not remember them a we do 171 were it not for the unusual man 172 who came to be lead them in the new world 173 and the unusual book he left behind 174 a luminous text unlike any other account 175 of early american settlement 176 extraordinary both in what it say 177 and in what it pass over in silence 178 philbrick bradford of plymouth plantation 179 is one of the great book of american literature and history 180 that book more than anything 181 is a kind of bible in it own way 182 it steeped in the bible obviously 183 when it come to it language 184 but when it come to the history of plymouth colony 185 it is ithei text 186 and there stuff there that is very dark and turbulent 187 narrator he labored over the manuscript for more than 20 year 188 scribbled writing he said pieced up in time of leisure 189 stolen from his duty a governor 190 and written in the third person a if to a far distant future 191 he left the manuscript to his son and heir 192 the day he died in 1657 along with a handful of simple poem 193 written in the first person 194 the book itself almost never came down to posterity 195 donegan in bradford role a a historian 196 he ha the possibility of success 197 because he ha the possibility to shape that history 198 he get to write for posterity he get to shape the story 199 bradford is clearly writing for a future 200 plymouth he understands will have it future in it history 201 and he the one who creating that history 202 bradford from my year young in day of youth 203 god did make known to me his truth 204 and called me from my native place 205 for to enjoy the mean of grace 206 in wilderness he did me guide 207 and in strange land for me provide 208 in fear and want through weal and woe 209 a pilgrim passed i to and fro 210 bunker in england the place that is most closely associated 211 with the origin of the pilgrim is a village called scrooby 212 which is right at the northern corner 213 of the county of nottinghamshire 214 it about 150 mile north of london 215 it wa an area where religious division 216 were particularly conspicuous 217 where there wa still quite a large number 218 of lingering roman catholic 219 an area which had recently been evangelized 220 by radical protestantism 221 allan you have the right people at the right time 222 in the right area with the same idea 223 and i think thats what happened up here 224 in this part of the country 225 got john robinson at gainsborough 226 youve got william brewster there at scrooby 227 you have richard clifton here at babworth 228 you have william bradford in austerfield 229 so spiritually strong and so young 230 they supported each other 231 and i think that is why it took off here 232 and maybe not in other place 233 narrator he wa born in the tiny village of austerfield 234 in south yorkshire and baptized on march 19 1590 235 in the ancient stone church of st helena 236 a threemile walk down a path called low common lane 237 from the village of scrooby 238 with farmland of their own and a sturdy house 239 his family though far from wealthy 240 were far from poor especially compared with their neighbor 241 tenant farmer and landless field hand 242 for the most part 243 but his childhood would be blighted 244 by the death of virtually everyone close to him 245 his father william when he wa one 246 his grandfather william when he wa six 247 his mother alice when he wa seven 248 his sister alice and his grandfather john hanson 249 when he wa 12 250 he wa sent to live with his uncle robert 251 who hoped he would prove useful working in the field 252 by then his family economic security had been badly shaken 253 by four failed harvest in a row 254 the great dearth of the 1590s 255 and by the devastating depression that followed 256 bunker the standard of living of the average english laborer 257 wa rapidly declining 258 it wa something very close to famine 259 so it wa a very uncertain world 260 in which even people from the yeomanry 261 a the pilgrim were were always worried 262 they were about to slip back into this state 263 of neardestitution in which many people lived 264 narrator lonely and intelligent in a world that felt 265 increasingly precarious and unmoored to him 266 he fell ill when he wa 12 267 with what he called a long sickness 268 which took him from the field kept him bedridden for month 269 and drove him to seek solace in the bible 270 the reading of scripture he said 271 made a great impression upon him 272 and the more he read the more troubled he became 273 at the gulf between the world he saw around him 274 and the simplicity and purity of the gospel 275 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name 276 philbrick he had this profound sense a a 12 year old 277 that the congregation he wa a part of wa corrupt 278 that the church wa moving them 279 in a direction that wa not right 280 that they prayed to the depraved belief of mortal men 281 that were moving them away from god 282 and so this wa a deep conviction 283 and i think there you have the beginning 284 of a very complex inwardlooking person 285 who wa improbably preparing for the ultimate journey 286 narrator when he wa well again he went with a friend 287 to all saint church at babworth ten mile away 288 to hear the illuminating ministry 289 of a forwardthinking puritan preacher named richard clyfton 290 not long after he found his way down low common lane 291 to the home of william brewster 292 the warmhearted cambridgeeducated postmaster 293 and bailiff of scrooby manor 294 where he came to feel he had found a spiritual home 295 and where each week a private congregation gathered 296 to hear richard clyfton 297 and another charismatic minister named john robinson 298 preach on the need to purify worship of everything worldly 299 of anything not contained in scripture 300 your carcass shall fall 301 hardman moore i think the sense of faithfulness to scripture 302 is at the heart of it 303 let u pray 304 hardman moore they want to go right back to the root 305 and strip away all the human accretion 306 that have come into the worship and the life of the church 307 and get back to a primitive purity 308 it no accident that the larger movement 309 from which the separatist came 310 were called puritan by their opponent 311 because thats what they were campaigning for 312 greater purity greater faithfulness 313 to what they believed they read in scripture 314 narrator nothing he read made a deeper impression on him 315 than a passage from the book of st matthew 316 in which christ explains to his disciple 317 where the true church lie 318 for where two or three are gathered together in my name 319 there am i in the midst of them 320 croft thats obviously 321 the key separatist text 322 that christ will be with you without a bishop 323 without a church 324 without any clear ecclesiastical organization 325 and that prayer conversion commitment 326 is enough for the presence of christ 327 thats an extraordinarily radical text 328 when you think about it 329 philbrick it a powerful idea to think that you can 330 in an unmediated way see god 331 the bible is your window in 332 and to have a bishop or a pope telling you what to do 333 is just getting in the way is so much fallen static 334 and it a powerful idea 335 i think it particularly powerful 336 for someone like bradford who find himself alone at 12 337 and to think that god is that accessible 338 that if he can find just a few others 339 and have a congregation of people 340 on the same wavelength 341 that they can find their way to god 342 thats what you need 343 thats all you need 344 and youre willing to go 345 to the end of the earth literally 346 if you know that you will be following that path 347 narrator by 1603 he wa fully committed to the radical idea 348 that the true love of god might mean separating 349 allan and thats when the real trouble begin 350 because you look at who the head 351 of the oy church in england 352 the head of the church from henry time is the monarch 353 it not just the church 354 it the monarch that youre flying in the face of 355 thats what make this so dangerous 356 and so worrying for the authority 357 because if youre going to make a stand on religion 358 and get away with it 359 then what else are you going to make a stand on 360 your carcass will fall in the wilderness 361 michael braddick the issue at stake 362 are literally more important than life and death 363 it your eternal life or your eternal death 364 and if your monarch is jeopardizing your eternal life 365 youre a very unreliable subject 366 because anyone who separate from the church 367 is not just separating from the church 368 but theyre separating from royal authority 369 and thats potentially very dangerous 370 allan bottom line what wa at stake 371 well their life 372 you can punish somebody for not attending a church 373 you can be fined and it wa 20 pound in those day 374 about 9000 pound in today money 375 thats a lot of money just for not going to church 376 if you persisted then you could be imprisoned 377 so you could think about it 378 and elizabeth after the act against puritan in 1593 379 had made the next step banishment 380 but i think with james 381 the next step could have been death for these people 382 he wa newly to the throne not popular 383 he wasnt going to have any dissenter 384 so i really think that these folk were risking everything 385 hardman moore and in area like this 386 where people had been perhaps able to get away with thing 387 there wa a new drive to make sure 388 that everyone conformed to the church of england 389 and there were explicit rule that said 390 you couldnt have private religious meeting in house 391 minister should not convene private group of people 392 these conventicle were judged illegal 393 and subversive to order in the realm 394 and for that reason a network of people here 395 came to feel that they were under pressure 396 narrator in the fall of 1607 397 when william brewster himself wa fined 398 and threatened with imprisonment 399 it wa clear that only one option remained 400 to worship god a they saw fit 401 they must separate not only from the english church 402 but from england altogether 403 braddick holland had emerged 404 a the protestant part of the netherlands 405 opposed to catholic rule in the south 406 it wa a place of refuge for evangelicals 407 in a time of threat and challenge 408 so you can see the attraction 409 from here to the humber estuary and to amsterdam 410 is not very far 411 allan but they couldnt just leave the country 412 because you needed permission to pas port 413 and dissenter werent going to get permission 414 to leave the country 415 theyd have to escape from their own country 416 narrator a first desperate attempt to flee ended in disaster 417 when the english sea captain they had hired 418 betrayed them to the authority 419 eight month later 420 on a clouddarkened evening in the spring of 1608 421 they tried again some fleeing by barge 422 down the trent and the humber towards hull 423 where this time 16 of the men 424 including 18yearold william bradford 425 managed to board a dutch ship and get away to sea 426 one step ahead of the searcher in pursuit 427 who arrested the terrified woman and child 428 and carted them off to jail 429 they were soon released 430 and over the next year in group of two and three 431 quietly made their way across the north sea to amsterdam 432 and joined their friend and family member in exile 433 croft and so they join the radical protestant of their time 434 the dutch 435 and james for the monarchy wa let them go there 436 if thats where theyre happy 437 no reason why they shouldnt go there 438 the dutch are our ally 439 weve been fighting on the side of the dutch 440 if you want to live there fair enough 441 good riddance 442 and no doubt many of them would have thought 443 that they would settle there quite happily 444 and that would be it 445 allan these folk mainly were tied to the land 446 they were used to england 447 a far a we know 448 only william brewster spoke the language 449 and youre going to a country 450 where you dont speak the language 451 you dont know the custom 452 how are you going to survive 453 and there wa no coming back 454 narrator in 1609 fearing the congregation would come apart 455 in the sprawling dutch metropolis 456 william brewster and john robinson 457 led their people 22 mile south to the city of leiden 458 a university town 459 and the bustling heart of the dutch textile industry 460 philbrick holland wa a completely different environment 461 from what they were used to 462 and because they were foreigner 463 they ended up getting really lousy job 464 instead of farm they ended up basically in little factory 465 creating clothing 466 and they would work literally from dawn till dusk 467 a bell would go off in the morning 468 and theyd work to the very end of the day 469 often with their child 470 narrator with no family of his own william bradford found lodging 471 in a poor neighborhood called stink alley 472 until at 21 he wa able to set up shop 473 in a small house of his own 474 toiling six and sometimes seven day a week a a weaver 475 croft it clear that many of them found it very harsh 476 the climate wa far harsher than they expected 477 the difficulty that they encountered were much greater 478 narrator but for all the trial and hardship 479 they would look back on these year 480 with an almost rapturous longing and nostalgia 481 for the world they created around them there 482 free for the first time to worship a they wished 483 in accordance with god will unmolested 484 such wa the true piety the humble zeal 485 and fervent love of this people whilst they thus lived together 486 towards god and his way 487 and the single heartedness 488 and sincere affection one towards another 489 that they came a near the primitive pattern 490 of the first church 491 a any other church of these latter time have done 492 hardman moore i think there something about what you might call 493 the glory day in leiden 494 the community that john robinson build around himself 495 his house the sort of cottage surrounding it 496 the meeting hall 497 it very much based on what they read 498 in the letter of the early church 499 paul letter in the new testament 500 about what it mean to be a community 501 in the body of christ 502 they would take a vision of what that had been for them in leiden 503 across the atlantic to the new world 504 narrator in 1613 william bradford 505 married a young english woman named dorothy may 506 not in a religious service performed in a church 507 but in a civil ceremony at leiden grand city hall 508 in accordance with dutch custom 509 and because the separatist found no precedent in the bible 510 for churchordained wedding 511 it wa the beginning of the separation of church and state 512 another custom they would take with them across the atlantic 513 sooner than anyone could have imagined 514 a by 1617 it had begun to clear 515 that leiden wa not the promised land after all 516 philbrick their biggest concern after a decade in this foreign land 517 wa that their child were becoming tch 518 and these people had decided to leave england 519 for their religious belief 520 but they were still very proud of their english heritage 521 and so if we stay in holland 522 we will lose the identity that is so essential to who we are 523 they were also fearful 524 that the spanish were about to attack again 525 narrator in late november 1618 526 a brilliant bluegreen comet appeared in the night sky 527 we shall have war 528 the english ambassador to the netherlands wrote 529 and he wa right 530 bunker europe wa on the verge of an enormous conflict 531 the beginning of what we now refer to 532 a the thirty year war a great religious conflict 533 involving all the great power of europe 534 which protestant such a the pilgrim saw 535 a a great confrontation between good 536 in the shape of protestant christianity 537 and evil in the shape of roman catholicism 538 and this in the eye of many 539 wa a cataclysmic global confrontation 540 which might very well lead to the end of the world 541 it might herald if you like 542 the second coming of christ and the day of judgment 543 thing were that urgent the stake were that high 544 philbrick everything seemed to be on the edge of complete meltdown 545 and so they decided it time to pull the rip cord once again 546 even if it meant leaving everything they had known 547 all their life 548 allan but where do you go 549 youre englishman after all 550 but you cant go back to england 551 and i think thats why they plumped for the new world 552 if you cant go back to england at least maybe they could find 553 the freedom theyre looking for there 554 narrator after weighing and rejecting numerous option 555 they settled in the end 556 on an area at the mouth of the hudson river 557 near present day new york 558 in the northern most part of the english colony 559 founded by the virginia company 560 then set out to try and get a legal charter 561 and permission to emigrate 562 philbrick what they had to do to get there required an awful lot of them 563 they really had to figure out how they were going to do this 564 and like many people from cult they were really naive 565 when it came to the rest of the world 566 and so it meant that they were very prone to being duped 567 when it came to trying to figure out 568 how are we going to do this 569 who are we going to hire 570 who going to be our military officer 571 where are we going to find a ship 572 who going to finance this endeavor 573 and these were not wealthy people 574 and so they had this huge list of problem 575 narrator they had all but despaired of finding anyone 576 willing to finance the hugely costly highrisk undertaking 577 when in early 1620 they were approached in leiden 578 by a 35yearold broker from london named thomas weston 579 who offered to organize financing for the expedition 580 through a group called 581 the fellowship of the merchant adventurer 582 hardman moore and that is the beginning of all sort of trouble for them 583 the right time to make that westward crossing 584 of the atlantic is to set out in the spring 585 so the pilgrim get themselves ready in leiden 586 and it june when they discover that weston 587 hasnt organized any transport 588 narrator to their deep dismay weston also now informed them 589 that the investor were getting cold foot 590 and insisting that nonseparatist outsider 591 go along with them 592 the prospect wa appalling 593 but there wa nothing they could do 594 in june with no word about financing 595 or the ship weston swore 596 would be waiting for them in southampton 597 they arranged their own passage across the english channel 598 on an aging vessel called the ispeedwelli 599 on july 22 they bid a heartwrenching farewell 600 to those staying behind including pastor robinson 601 who it wa decided would remain in leiden 602 with the main congregation 603 until a secure beachhead had been established 604 in anguish william and dorothy bradford 605 left their threeyearold son john in the care of relative 606 john demo there wa deep sorrow 607 at the bottom of this decision for many of them 608 a they got on the boat 609 they knew at least most of them 610 had no chance to come back 611 they were never going to see the people 612 who had meant the most to them up to that point 613 they were going to something they could barely imagine 614 and so they left that goodly and pleasant city 615 which had been their resting place near 12 year 616 but they knew they were pilgrim 617 and looked not much on these thing 618 but lift up their eye to the heaven 619 their dearest country and quieted their spirit 620 narrator the journey across the channel to southampton 621 wa swift and uneventful 622 and when they arrived to their enormous relief 623 they found waiting for them at the dock a second ship 624 which thomas weston had secured for them 625 at the last possible moment 626 a mediumsized 180ton squarerigged merchant vessel 627 battered from use 628 but at 100 foot three time longer than the speedwell 629 seasoned and sweetened 630 from year of shuttling across the channel 631 taking bale of wool to france 632 and barrel of wine back to england 633 it wa called the imayfloweri 634 here too they had their first encounter 635 with the imayflowersi captain christopher jones 636 and with it hardbitten roughandtumble crew 637 and with the stranger 638 the motley assortment of nonseparatist recruit 639 the investor had insisted go with them 640 philbrick suddenly these leideners who had spent ten year 641 cultivating their own spiritual and very inward bond 642 found themselves on a ship 643 sharing their space with the stranger 644 who came from a completely different place 645 with the understanding that 646 were not just sharing the ship with them 647 were going to be living with these people 648 for the foreseeable future 649 narrator the 650 mayflower and the ispeedwelli 651 had finally weighed anchor 652 and were just beginning to make headway 653 when to their shock and dismay 654 the 655 speedwell 656 began to wallow and take on water 657 hardman moore it sprang leak like a sieve 658 they kept on having to put back into port 659 because the ispeedwell wa leakingi 660 and finally in plymouth 661 they had to abandon the ispeedwelli altogether 662 and everyone went aboard the imayfloweri and set off 663 narrator it wa up to the imayfloweri now to sail on on her own 664 crowded with a many passenger from both ship 665 a she could hold 666 many had to be left behind 667 when all wa said and done 668 there were only 102 passenger on board 669 only half of whom were member 670 of the original leiden congregation 671 bunker it wa a long process 672 before they could finally get away to sea 673 out onto the open atlantic 674 and it wa far too late in the year 675 if you wanted to go to america to virginia or new england 676 you should try to leave february or march at the latest 677 so you could get there in the spring 678 and give yourself a full spring and summer 679 to become accustomed to the new world 680 and to do all the thing you had to do 681 before the winter set in 682 in fact of course they ended up leaving in september 683 which wa about a bad a it could be 684 narrator on september 6 1620 fearfully late in the season 685 undersupplied and overcrowded 686 with autumn storm already whipping the north atlantic 687 into menacing furrow of white capped wave 688 thei mayflower left plymouth harbori 689 and set out on her own across the atlantic 690 edward winslow a 24yearold printer 691 traveling with his wife elizabeth 692 never forgot the moment they set sail 693 winslow dramatized wednesday the sixth of september 694 the wind coming east northeast a fine small gale 695 we loosed from plymouth having been kindly entertained 696 and courteously used by diver friend there dwelling 697 narrator the imayfloweri lost sight of land end 698 sometime towards the end of the first week of september 699 it wa starting to gale 700 william bradford remembered her finally setting forth 701 under a prosperous wind 702 hardman moore when they finally set sail 703 theyre going against the prevailing westerly wind 704 theyre struggling against the gulf stream 705 and they made incredibly slow progress 706 two mile an hour across the atlantic 707 philbrick some of them tried to create little cabin within this 708 which just made these little suffocating cell 709 and chamber pot everywhere 710 there wa a boat that had been cut up into piece 711 that some people were trying to use for a bed 712 there were two dog a spaniel and a giant slobbery mastiff 713 and it is a voyage from hell 714 bailyn they almost turned back 715 the sailor at one point 716 said theyd be happy to earn their wage 717 but theyre not going to risk their life 718 bradford spell it out 719 he describes it a awful 720 and these terrible sailor who were a blight on humanity 721 and the stranger some of whom were worse 722 loaded up with all this gear animal people 723 it amazing that they came out alive 724 philbrick and by the end of it people are getting sick 725 and so there wa a real sense of urgency aboard 726 particularly for master jones who knew at some point 727 he had to get these people off his ship 728 narrator two people had died and more were failing fast 729 when early on the morning of thursday november 9 1620 730 after more than two month at sea 731 a crew member spied a line of high bluff 732 gleaming far off in the early dawn light 733 and shouted out excitedly to captain jones 734 it wa the first land they had seen in 65 day 735 but their jubilation quickly dimmed 736 a word raced through the ship that they had made landfall 737 far north of their intended destination 738 philbrick theyve arrived off the coast of cape cod 739 but theyre 200 mile off course 740 and so master jones head them south 741 towards the hudson river 742 and unfortunately there are no reliable chart 743 and they unsuspectingly find themselves 744 in one of the most dangerous piece of shoal water 745 on the atlantic coast 746 theyre in the midst of what bradford would call 747 roaring breaker 748 and it look like this is going to be the end of them 749 and jones make a very historic decision 750 he say were not going south 751 were going to take this breeze to the north 752 around the wrist of what they called cape cod 753 to whatever harbor is there 754 and im getting these people off my ship 755 narrator on november 11 1620 they rounded the tip of cape cod 756 and sailed into the relative calm and safety 757 of the great bay 758 where even before they dropped anchor 759 long festering tension between the stranger and the pilgrim 760 broke out into the open 761 having landed so far north 762 of the boundary of their legal patent 763 many of the stranger insisted 764 they were now bound by nothing at all 765 and began to speak openly of splintering off 766 and going their own way once they came ashore 767 bradford this day before we came to harbor 768 observing some not well affected to unity and concord 769 but gave some appearance of faction 770 it wa thought good there should be 771 an association and agreement 772 that we should combine together in one body 773 and submit to such government and governor 774 a we should by common consent agree to make and choose 775 and set our hand to this that follows word for word 776 narrator william brewster in all likelihood 777 drafted the short agreement 778 little more than a single sentence long 779 stating that they agreed to combine themselves 780 together into a civil body politic 781 with the power to enact whatever law proved necessary 782 to preserve the group 783 demo the point of the compact wa to ward off the danger 784 of division and dissolution 785 after they got to the other side 786 the thing thats key about it is it a contract 787 it not exactly an elaborate plan for democracy 788 it a contract 789 were going to agree on this particular goal 790 and get everybodys name on this document 791 and make a commitment to this 792 narrator on the morning of november 11 1620 793 the mayflower compact wa offered up for signature 794 the first to sign wa john carver 795 one of the wealthiest men on board 796 the last a servant named edward leister 797 in the end the vast majority of the men on board 798 put their name to the paper 41 adult men in all 799 90 percent of the adult male population of the imayfloweri 800 year later when william bradford and others 801 codified the rule of plymouth colony in a new book of law 802 on the very first page they described the compact a 803 a solemn and binding combination 804 whose authority came from the fact that 805 it wa based upon the vote of the governed 806 although the compact began 807 with an affirmation of loyalty to king james 808 the book of law made clear that at time of political crisis 809 the authority of the monarch could sometimes be suspended 810 while the consent of the governed could never be 811 once the signing wa complete 812 the colonist acted collectively for the first time 813 and elected john carver to be their governor 814 at least for the moment 815 from the relative safety of the ship at anchor in cape cod bay 816 the threat to the corporate integrity of the colony 817 had been averted 818 bradford being thus past the vast ocean and a sea of trouble 819 they had now no friend to welcome them 820 or inn to repair to 821 or to refresh their weatherbeaten body 822 no house much le town to repair to 823 to seek for succor 824 and for the season it wa winter 825 and they that know the winter of that country 826 know them to be sharp and harsh 827 subject to cruel and fierce storm 828 besides what could they see 829 but a hideous desolate wilderness 830 full of wild beast and wild men 831 narrator on november 11 832 with their ship safely anchored off the tip of cape cod 833 a landing party of 16 armed men 834 including william bradford edward winslow 835 and the veteran english soldier they had hired mile standish 836 ventured ashore in a small boat and stepped on dry land 837 for the first time in two month 838 though they walked for hour amongst the windswept dune 839 before returning to the imayfloweri 840 with a boatload of freshly cut fire wood 841 on their first excursion ashore they found no wild beast 842 and stranger still 843 no sign of any human presence at all wild or otherwise 844 back on the ship a the sun went down 845 the enormity of their situation began to sink in upon them 846 there on the edge of the dark whispering continent 847 time seemed to stand still for the immigrant 848 then widen into an ominous void 849 for summer being done 850 all thing stand on them with a weather beaten face 851 a whole country full of wood and thicket 852 represented a wild and savage view 853 if they looked behind them 854 there wa the mighty ocean which they had passed 855 and wa now a a main bar and gulf to separate them 856 from all the civil part of the world 857 let it also be considered what weak hope 858 of supply and succor they left behind them 859 what could now sustain them 860 but the spirit of god and his grace 861 may not and ought not 862 the child of these father rightly say 863 our father were englishman 864 which come over this great ocean 865 and were ready to perish in this wilderness 866 but they cried unto the lord and he heard their voice 867 and looked on their adversity et cetera 868 let them therefore praise the lord 869 because he is good and his mercy endure forever 870 braddick in southeastern massachusetts east of narragansett bay 871 thats wampanoag territory 872 to the north of u wa the massachusett 873 to the west wa the nipmuc 874 to the south were the narragansett 875 the pequot mohegan niantic 876 we estimate that within that area we had about 69 village 877 a village could be anywhere from 100 people to 2000 878 so round it off at 1000 average 879 and youve got close to 70000 people 880 in 1616 before the coming of the pilgrim 881 there wa a huge plague 882 it started in maine brought over by european fisherman 883 it swept a 15milewide path right down the coast 884 sort of took a left through the middle of wampanoag country 885 and stopped at narragansett bay 886 the wampanoag and i think any other group that it hit 887 suffered anywhere from a 50 to a 90 loss in population 888 donegan it happened so quickly 889 the mean of death were so sudden and yet relentless 890 and english fisherman explorer come to the coast 891 and say it absolutely abandoned it devastated 892 where did the people go 893 and from that time to 1619 894 thats what they found emptiness 895 abandoned village bone scattered around the ground 896 tobias vanderhoop in some of the account 897 they found just bone bleached 898 not because we didnt have ritual and observance 899 but because there wasnt anybody left 900 to take care of the one who had passed away 901 narrator nowhere wa the devastation more complete 902 than in a village the wampanoag called patuxet 903 one villager named tisquantum 904 kidnapped two year before the plague began 905 and carried off in chain to europe 906 returned in 1619 to find his village completely abandoned 907 vanderhoop tisquantum wa fortunate 908 along with others who had been kidnapped 909 from wampanoag territory to make their way back home 910 only to find the devastation that ha occurred 911 patuxet is gone 912 donegan it wa a village of about 2000 people 913 and when tisquantum came back not one had survived 914 no one 915 he wa the only survivor of his entire village 916 it unimaginable the grief the loss of that 917 and this is the world into which the pilgrim enter 918 marge bruchac it very convenient for the telling of american history 919 to start with the plague 920 to start with this massive death 921 but when those plague happen 922 they are not a total a they appear 923 there are some area that were virtually untouched 924 by the plague 925 it wa not so empty that it wa ready to be reoccupied 926 by someone from across the ocean 927 vanderhoop but when they arrived in this territory 928 they believed that their journey wa ordained by god 929 that they had a mission that they were to fulfill 930 and the desolation that they found wa god providence 931 it wa meant to be that way for them 932 bruchac they did not view native people a human 933 they saw them almost a beast and vermin 934 who were cleared away by god pestilence 935 to make room for god chosen people 936 and so i think it necessary to ask who the savage were 937 were they the people who had lived in this territory 938 for millennium or were they these people 939 who forced themselves in to someone el home 940 narrator they spent their first month tethered to the ship 941 while three successive scouting party 942 probedheir way down the long arm of the cape 943 towards the mainland looking for fresh water 944 and a suitable place to settle for the winter 945 on their first day out 946 they caught sight of six men and a dog 947 walking far down the beach 948 the first native inhabitant they had seen 949 the men stared back at them for a moment 950 then whistled for the dog 951 and disappeared into the line of tree 952 a they moved 953 through the strange and inscrutable landscape 954 filled with sign of human presence 955 they could see but not understand 956 their first halting foray 957 had a primal transgressive unsettling character to them 958 donegan in the first scouting mission 959 they found a sand mound d started to dig it up 960 and they realized this might be a grave 961 so they stopped digging 962 bradford doesnt report that in his history 963 edward winslow doe 964 what bradford report is coming on another place 965 finding the same kind of mound digging it up 966 and finding basket of corn 967 they take away half the corn 968 then what happens on the second scouting trip 969 bradford doesnt report at all 970 but winslow give u a long account 971 of a smaller group 972 going in through the wood to an indian village 973 and finding something that look like a grave 974 so they begin to dig and this time they continue 975 they start taking out the good 976 they start taking out the plank 977 they start taking out the mat 978 until they find two bundle one larger and one smaller 979 they open up the first bundle and the first thing they notice 980 is that it full of this fine red powder 981 that ha a kind of smell 982 they say it not a bad smell but the smell come up to them 983 they look further in 984 and they see the bone and skull of a man 985 the face still ha skin clinging to it 986 but whats most startling 987 is that the skull is covered with blond hair 988 so they know that this is not an indian 989 but the body of a european 990 they open up the second mat 991 and the find the bone and the skull of a child 992 and the child body is decorated 993 with white indian bead and bracelet 994 and there are little childish thing around 995 so there this mystery 996 what ha happened here 997 who are these body 998 what are they doing in the same grave 999 what wa the relationship between these dead body 1000 and the living hand that put them there 1001 and they can not construct a narrative about that 1002 and this make them think of their own situation 1003 how will we die here 1004 whose hand will attend to u 1005 what will happen to u here 1006 narrator they moved on 1007 a few night later at a place called first encounter beach 1008 they were attacked in the dark by a party of warrior 1009 for hour the air wa filled 1010 with war cry and whistling arrow 1011 which they answered with deafening blast of musket fire 1012 until the attacker withdrew 1013 thus it pleased god william bradford wrote 1014 to vanquish our enemy and give u deliverance 1015 finally on december 8 1016 on the far western shore of the bay 1017 they came upon a site 1018 they determined might suit them for a settlement 1019 bailyn it wa an indian settlement that had been abandoned 1020 it seemed physically speaking a proper place 1021 and it had a nice slope 1022 down to the harbor and field beyond 1023 and that seemed to be a convenient place 1024 bruchac and one of the sad tragic irony 1025 is that the place that the plymouth colonist 1026 settle on for their location 1027 is the village that wa perhaps the hardest hit 1028 of all the wampanoag vlages patuxet 1029 to the point where there are body lying on the ground 1030 that can not be buried because there are no relative 1031 and from a native perspective 1032 you would not reoccupy those place 1033 so people must have thought the pilgrim were insane 1034 to come and settle in a place 1035 where there been so much death and loss 1036 narrator on december 12 the third and final scouting party 1037 sailed back across the bay to the waiting imayfloweri 1038 where william bradford wa greeted with staggering news 1039 five day earlier his 23yearold wife dorothy 1040 had somehow fallen overboard while the ship lay at anchor 1041 and drowned in the icy water of the bay 1042 allan the deck were icy 1043 she could have slipped overboard 1044 she could equally have been suffering from depression 1045 maybe it wa too much leaving her child behind 1046 maybe with the advanced scurvy 1047 which can give you the feeling of not just depression 1048 but of being doomed 1049 did she slip herself into the water 1050 philbrick and to this day people are wondering 1051 well wa it just an accident 1052 we have a tendency i think 1053 to think that people of this enormous religious belief 1054 would never take their life 1055 and thats not the case at all 1056 and the fact of the matter is despair wa a huge part 1057 of what all of them were feeling 1058 a child had just died the day before her death 1059 narrator william bradford never spoke of dorothys death in his history 1060 and the circumstance were never explained 1061 late in life he penned the line of a simple poem 1062 bradford faint not poor soul in god still trust 1063 fear not the thing thou suffer must 1064 for whom he love he doth chastise 1065 and then all tear wipe from their eye 1066 narrator on friday december 15 1620 1067 with it cargo of sickened and seaweary passenger and crew 1068 the imayfloweri sailed west across the vast windswept bay 1069 towards the dark wintry shore that awaited them 1070 they arrive just at the worst possible time 1071 winter is just coming in 1072 and it the end of december by the time they begin 1073 to start building house 1074 hardman moore the imayfloweri had to anchor a mile offshore 1075 because the harbor at plymouth wasnt deep enough 1076 to let the ship right up 1077 so that they had to ferry 1078 the supply the good so slowly 1079 in from the imayfloweri 1080 and they managed to build only very few house 1081 far fewer than theyd anticipated 1082 bailyn everything wa wrong 1083 i mean they had to reach the shore 1084 by wading through icecold water to the shoreline 1085 and bradford say at one point with sleet beating at them 1086 they were covered with this ice glaze 1087 and they caught cold and they died 1088 edward winslow friday the 22nd 1089 the storm still continued that we could not get aland 1090 nor they come to u aboard 1091 woman push push 1092 winslow this morning goodwife allerton wa delivered of a son 1093 but dead born 1094 sunday the 24th our people on shore 1095 heard a cry of some savage which caused an alarm 1096 and to stand on their guard expecting an assault 1097 but all wa quiet 1098 narrator they had just set to work building a 21squarefoot 1099 common house for protection against indian attack 1100 when the temperature dropped 1101 and the weather closed in mercilessly 1102 one by one the weakened immigrant began to succumb 1103 to dysentery pneumonia tuberculosis exposure 1104 hardman moore that first sickness that general mortality 1105 must have been so pervasive 1106 at one time in that first winter 1107 two or three people were dying every day 1108 the number of people who were sick and needed caring for 1109 it must have been overwhelming 1110 i think there is something particularly devastating 1111 about what happens to them that first winter 1112 narrator by february people were dying in drove 1113 some huddled in the makeshift settlement 1114 many more back on the imayflower which had been convertedi 1115 to a hospital for the sick and a hospice for the dying 1116 allan the condition onboard that ship must have been absolutely awful 1117 they cant go ashore 1118 theyre all suffering from scurvy 1119 that sweet ship the imayfloweri 1120 by the end it wa like a death house on the water 1121 it pleased god to visit u then with death daily 1122 and with so general a disease 1123 that the living were scarce able to bury the dead 1124 and the well in no measure sufficient to tend the sick 1125 philbrick by the spring half of them are dead 1126 50some people die that first year 1127 and by all right they all should have died 1128 given how illprepared they were 1129 narrator what happened that first winter 1130 wa more than most of the grieving survivor could bear 1131 the full horror of what they went through 1132 wa fated to live on only in the margin of history 1133 donegan in bradford history he really turn away 1134 from the corps 1135 there no record of burial which with mass mortality 1136 with the dead outnumbering the living 1137 would account for a major activity of the group 1138 so the question becomes what happened to the dead 1139 and what we do know is hidden in a piece of court testimony 1140 by a man named phineas pratt 1141 he came in 1623 to find the plymouth colony 1142 completely devastated 1143 and he asks where are the rest of our friend 1144 and the answer he report is god took them away by death 1145 and we were so dejected and so frightened that first winter 1146 that those who could carried our sick men into the wood 1147 and propped them up against tree 1148 with their musket by their side so that the indian 1149 looking in through the forest would think that we had a guard 1150 a forest sentinel 1151 so the well bradford tell u are nursing the sick 1152 but what phineas pratt tell u is those who have strength 1153 are carrying sick and dying body into the wood 1154 and propping them up against tree 1155 later when increase mather is writing a history of plymouth 1156 he quote phineas pratt 1157 but right at that terribly transgressive moment 1158 mather change the story and insert instead 1159 that they buried their dead at night 1160 so a to keep their loss from the indian 1161 and then a the story of the pilgrim dead 1162 get told and retold then the story of night burial 1163 start to get remembered and cherished and elaborated 1164 and it come to be not only that they do night burial 1165 but that they plant corn over the graf so that the indian 1166 dont notice how many loss that they have 1167 but what really happened 1168 get completely dropped out of the history 1169 it is too transgressive and very dangerous 1170 a the story about the corps falling in the wilderness 1171 come to pas 1172 and this place becomes this place of death 1173 both native and english and so they had to make 1174 some kind of meaning out of that 1175 it couldnt just be a waste yard of bone for everyone 1176 they have to mean differently 1177 so they started to assign different meaning 1178 to indian death and english death 1179 indian death were just bone scattered on the ground 1180 were forgotten people were just material 1181 indian death wa about becoming carrion waste 1182 dispossession 1183 whereas english death wa about becoming the seed buried 1184 possession 1185 english death wa going to be remembered 1186 wa going to be honored 1187 and bradford make very much of this 1188 because in his history 1189 what he ha to do is plant those people in plymouth 1190 to make a kind of permanence there 1191 to claim that ground a a ground of history 1192 so putting body into the ground 1193 even though theyre scarce buried 1194 is a way of making that ground sacred 1195 it could be that the most important thing 1196 that the people of plymouth planted wa their dead 1197 narrator the day were growing longer 1198 and the death rate had finally begun to subside 1199 when on friday march 16 1200 cry of panic and alarm rang out a a lone warrior 1201 naked except for a loin cloth and carrying a bow 1202 broke cover from the line of tree near their hut 1203 and walked boldly into the camp 1204 edward winslow he saluted u in english and bade u welcome 1205 he wa the first savage we had met withal 1206 he said his name wa samoset 1207 he told u the place we now live is called patuxet 1208 and that about four year ago 1209 all the inhabitant died of an extraordinary plague 1210 so a there is none to hinder our possession 1211 or to lay claim unto it 1212 donegan the wampanoag are looking for an ally 1213 theyre suspicious of the pilgrim when they first come 1214 they stay away from them at first they watch them 1215 but eventually they realize that an alliance 1216 is going to be best for them a well 1217 vanderhoop it wa not just a political convenience it wa survival 1218 if you do not have power backing you 1219 and you are a weakened people then the enemy 1220 that naturally exist around you will take advantage 1221 and our leadership knew very well 1222 the tough decision that needed to be made at the time 1223 in order to ensure that wampanoag people 1224 continued to exist in wampanoag territory 1225 narrator six day later the emissary returned 1226 bringing the principle leader of the wampanoag their massasoit 1227 and 60 of his men including tisquantum 1228 the sole survivor of patuxet who served a interpreter 1229 a the two side concluded a remarkable treaty 1230 agreeing among other thing not to harm each others people 1231 and to come to each others aid in the event of attack 1232 it wa also agreed that tisquantum would remain 1233 with the struggling group on the site of his former home 1234 to help with the spring planting 1235 philbrick both people were in a survival situation 1236 the wampanoag had been devastated by disease 1237 in the three year before and the neighboring narragansetts 1238 were threatening to really take them over 1239 the pilgrim were obviously very close to losing everything 1240 after that first winter and so they began to form 1241 an alliance with massasoit and the wampanoag 1242 and i think that defined so much of what happened 1243 in that first and second year 1244 narrator two week after concluding the treaty 1245 the immigrant gathered at the harbor 1246 to bid a somber farewell to the imayfloweri 1247 which on april 5 1621 set sail for england 1248 with captain jones an empty hold 1249 and a drastically diminished crew 1250 it wa one of the last voyage she would ever take 1251 in le than a year captain jones himself would be dead 1252 and two year after that the imayfloweri 1253 rotting at anchor on the thames would be sold for scrap 1254 and disappear to history 1255 the pilgrim only anchor and lifeline wa gone 1256 they were on their own 1257 with the return of warm weather they put in their first crop 1258 under tisquantums careful supervision 1259 planting herring in yardwide mound of earth 1260 sewn with corn seed and adding once the corn came up 1261 seed of squash and bean 1262 the coming of spring did not entirely halt 1263 the sad toll of death 1264 bradford in this month of april whilst they were busy about their seed 1265 their governor mr john carver came out of the field very sick 1266 it being a hot day he complained greatly of his head 1267 and lay down and within a few hour his sens failed 1268 so a he never spake more till he died 1269 shortly after william bradford wa chosen governor 1270 in his stead 1271 and by renewed election every year 1272 continued sundry year together which i here note once for all 1273 narrator all through the warm summer month the grieving immigrant 1274 labored to make a world for themselves building house 1275 tilling soil fishing for cod and bass in the bay 1276 in june they made their first tentative effort 1277 to trade with the native group around them 1278 in july william bradford sent edward winslow 1279 and stephen hopkins to visit the wampanoag in their village 1280 40 mile to the west to build on their alliance 1281 and to find out whom they had stolen corn seed from 1282 the previous december and to make reparation 1283 autumn came and the day dipped down into darkness 1284 by october they had finished erecting 11 crude structure 1285 in all seven dwelling house and four common building 1286 they had also managed to bring in a successful harvest of corn 1287 thanks to tisquantum and a the leaf began to turn 1288 they prepared edward winslow reported 1289 to in a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered 1290 the fruit of our labor 1291 no one at the time called it thanksgiving 1292 william bradford made no mention of it in his history 1293 braddick there isnt much of a record 1294 there a paragraph i think in winslow that describes 1295 whats come to be known a the first thanksgiving 1296 it say nothing about an invitation 1297 it just that the english were doing this thing 1298 and massasoit showed up with these 90 men 1299 they stayed for three day they went out and got five deer 1300 to add to what the english were cooking 1301 they played game together 1302 there like four little fact of what happened 1303 and then the rest of it is fluff thats been added 1304 over the century 1305 narrator twoandahalf century later at another american moment 1306 of great trial and suffering the humble event 1307 all but disregarded by the pilgrim themselves 1308 would be recast a one of the most important 1309 and defining moment in american history 1310 donegan we love the story of thanksgiving 1311 because it about alliance and abundance and envisioning 1312 a future where native american and colonial american 1313 can come together and celebrate the providence of a single god 1314 but part of the reason that they were grateful 1315 wa that they had been in such misery 1316 that they had lost so many people 1317 on both side 1318 so in some way that day of thanksgiving 1319 is also coming out of mourning it also coming out of grief 1320 and this abundance that is a relief from that loss 1321 but we dont think about the loss 1322 we think about the abundance 1323 cannon fire 1324 narrator on november 9 1621 a shout went up from a lookout 1325 on burial hill followed by the loud booming of a cannon 1326 a far out in the bay the first sail they had seen 1327 since the departure of the imayfloweri 1328 loomed on the eastern horizon 1329 they had had no contact with the outside world 1330 for more than a year 1331 though they feared at first it might be french pirate 1332 it turned out to be an english relief ship called the ifortunei 1333 sent by their mercurial broker thomas weston 1334 a third the size of the imayfloweri 1335 the tiny vessel carried 35 new recruit 1336 to bradford dismay only a handful of them separatist 1337 no supply to speak of more mouth to feed 1338 just a winter came on again 1339 and a stinging letter from thomas weston himself 1340 rebuking the colonist for having failed to send back 1341 any cargo with the imayfloweri 1342 when the ifortunei weighed anchor four week later 1343 they freighted it with a much beaver fur 1344 and timber a they could muster but it wa nowhere near enough 1345 to make a difference 1346 bunker they desperately needed to find something they could ship back 1347 to england to pay their debt 1348 and that just wasnt available 1349 in those early year in new england 1350 so there were all kind of challenge 1351 which they were not well prepared for 1352 narrator over the next 18 month a the pilgrim struggled 1353 to stay alive and keep their group together 1354 they would face staggering new challenge 1355 on not one but three front simultaneously 1356 economic and demographic 1357 a they struggled desperately to make end meet 1358 and to contend with the influx of what william bradford called 1359 profane and disorderly outsider but also military 1360 a it soon became terrifying clear that their alliance 1361 with the wampanoag would not be easily replicated 1362 with other group in the region 1363 the struggle with those challenge 1364 would change them forever 1365 donegan part of that ha to do with living in a world 1366 where it suddenly seems that no hold are barred 1367 where youre being forced to do thing that you never thought 1368 that you would be forced to do and youre willing to do thing 1369 that you never thought that you would be willing to do 1370 narrator ominous rumor had been swirling around the settlement 1371 for month first that the narragansetts 1372 then that the massachusetts were planning to attack 1373 when in early december william bradford ordered 1374 the construction of an eightfoothigh timber wall 1375 around the entire plantation for protection 1376 work on the massive fortification 1377 had just been completed when three new ship 1378 also sent by thomas weston appeared in the harbor 1379 their arrival would trigger the darkest crisis 1380 in the pilgrim history 1381 donegan thomas weston sponsored another competing trading post 1382 north of plymouth 1383 it wa very different from the pilgrim contingent 1384 they were not there for religious reason 1385 they did not have a social cohesion 1386 they did not have family structure 1387 they were there for financial reason 1388 and it wa a collection of young men 1389 narrator none of the 60 new colonist were separatist 1390 they had come to set up 1391 what amounted to a rival trading post 1392 and after four month of uneasy cohabitation 1393 with the colonist at plymouth moved 30 mile up the coast 1394 to a place called wessagussett near a massachusetts village 1395 still reeling from the recent epidemic 1396 donegan and thing very very quickly start deteriorating there 1397 they have terrible relationship with the native 1398 they run out of food 1399 the native start jeering at them making fun of them 1400 the people at wessagusset start trading their clothes 1401 for capful of corn they start working for the indian 1402 and the whole social structure of that trading post 1403 just absolutely fall apart 1404 thunder crackle 1405 narrator a the new colony disintegrated more bad news reached plymouth 1406 first that the ifortunei had been plundered on her return voyage 1407 leaving the colony for a second straight year 1408 with nothing to show for itself 1409 then that a massive indian uprising in virginia 1410 had killed 347 english colonist near jamestown 1411 bunker and the pilgrim feared that something similar 1412 wa about to happen to them 1413 and there were clear indication that they were under threat 1414 from some part of the local native american population 1415 narrator in march 1623 news reached plymouth that massasoit himself 1416 their only ally lay dying and william bradford 1417 quickly dispatched edward winslow to his bedside 1418 under the englishman skilled care 1419 the wampanoag leader made a rapid recovery 1420 and in return revealed 1421 that plymouth wa in the gravest danger 1422 from a regionwide conspiracy whose aim wa to eradicate 1423 all english settlement in new england 1424 donegan the massachusetts have a plan that they want to wipe out 1425 the wessagusset trading post 1426 but theyre afraid of retaliation from plymouth 1427 so the plan is to actually make a coalition 1428 and wipe out both wessagusset and plymouth 1429 bradford mr weston colony had by their evil and debauched carriage 1430 so exasperated the indian among them a they plotted 1431 their overthrow 1432 and because they knew not how to effect it 1433 for fear we would revenge it upon them 1434 they secretly instigated other people to conspire 1435 against u also thinking to assault u 1436 with their force at home 1437 but their treachery wa discovered unto u 1438 and we went to rescue the life of our countryman 1439 and also to take vengeance of them for their villainy 1440 donegan mile standish and allerton and bradford 1441 decide to make a preemptive strike 1442 mile standish and others go to wessagusset 1443 on the pretense of trade 1444 and they gather many of the indian men 1445 including two leader 1446 into the trading post supposedly for trade 1447 lock the door and on a signal kill these two men 1448 with their own knife hanging around their neck 1449 bailyn standish wa a war veteran 1450 and the veteran of the thirty year war 1451 were brute hammerers 1452 and they went up there a young indian boy they hung 1453 and then the rest they stabbed to death 1454 and cut off one of their head and brought it back 1455 and put it on a pole in the middle of plymouth 1456 donegan mile standish decapitates one of them and brings the head 1457 a a trophy back to plymouth where he is greeted with joy 1458 this is wituwamat 1459 the head is then erected on a pike 1460 and placed at the apex of their fort 1461 and it stay there for year 1462 bradford by the good providence of god 1463 we killed seven of the chief of them 1464 and the head of one of them stand still upon our fort 1465 for a terror unto others 1466 narrator when word of the attack reached leiden john robinson 1467 wrote an anguished letter back to william bradford 1468 john robinson dramatized concerning the killing of those poor indian 1469 oh 1470 how happy a thing had it been if you had converted some 1471 before you had killed any 1472 besides where blood is once begun to be shed 1473 it is seldom stanched of a long time after 1474 you will say they deserved it 1475 but upon what provocation by those heathenish christian 1476 it is also a thing more glorious in men eye 1477 than pleasing in god to be a terror to poor barbarous people 1478 yours truly loving john robinson 1479 narrator the bloodshed at wessagussett wa a watershed 1480 permanently altering the balance of power in the region 1481 in favor of the pilgrim and their ally the wampanoag 1482 five month later william bradford married 1483 a recently arrived 32yearold widow named alice southworth 1484 in a ceremony attended by the entire community 1485 donegan the pilgrim usually shun decoration ornamentation 1486 but when bradford get married 1487 people notice one piece of ornament 1488 a piece of linen soaked in wituwamats blood 1489 visitor to plymouth commented upon it 1490 it there in letter 1491 when massasoit come with his band to bradford wedding 1492 he see wituwamats head on the pike 1493 although to massasoit it wa a signal of the strength 1494 of his alliance with plymouth and plymouth willingness 1495 to take action against enemy 1496 narrator by 1623 the most immediate existential threat 1497 to the colony survival had started to recede 1498 but other challenge remained and in the long run 1499 these would prove even more intractable 1500 bailyn when you trace bradford thinking through these year 1501 what strike me most is the degree to which 1502 it wa a continuous disappointment 1503 by 1625 which is what 1504 just a few year from the beginning 1505 he already complaining that the group is dissipating 1506 that there are trouble 1507 that stranger and gentile of all sort are making trouble 1508 narrator in 1626 a gloom fell over the settlement 1509 when news came from leiden that john robinson had died 1510 the previous winter 1511 hardman moore and i think that wa a perpetual disappointment 1512 to brewster and to bradford 1513 they felt the pain of that very clearly 1514 that this person who wa 1515 the most crucial mentor for the whole group 1516 so instrumental in creating this community 1517 wa never there with them 1518 narrator in 1626 the investor in london 1519 convinced the colony would never show a profit 1520 filed for bankruptcy 1521 and disbanded the merchant adventurer 1522 most of the massive debt left behind wa assumed 1523 by eight of the colony most stalwart member 1524 who going forward would have a monopoly 1525 on whatever trade the company might be able to establish 1526 a prospect that by 1626 looked exceedingly bleak 1527 a most people on both side of the atlantic 1528 now assumed the blighted colony would soon fail completely 1529 but it didnt 1530 their business model leaned heavily on the idea that america 1531 wa a place of thing of incredible value 1532 now beaver are not quite a valuable a gold 1533 but it is still a valuable commodity 1534 and the beaver end up saving them 1535 bunker the pilgrim certainly did try to find beaver skin 1536 a soon a they could 1537 but although beaver skin were valuable 1538 the price wa relatively low during the early 1620s 1539 it rocketed up later on in 1627 1628 1540 it quadrupled and the pilgrim got the benefit of that 1541 but in order to really get fur in sufficient quantity 1542 they needed to get up to maine 1543 and edward winslow wa the key character in this 1544 because winslow had been going up to maine for several year 1545 the kennebec valley in maine 1546 or the penobscot valley in maine 1547 river valley where there are enormous supply 1548 of beaver fur readily available 1549 so everything came together in 1627 and 1628 1550 the price had gone up pilgrim had found the fur 1551 the opportunity presented itself 1552 and back came beaver skin in their thousand 1553 now once the pilgrim had been able to deliver beaver skin 1554 back to england in sufficient quantity to turn a profit 1555 investor in london saw that if you took this business model 1556 the pilgrim had developed then you might be able to build 1557 a much much bigger colony 1558 with not hundred of colonist but thousand of colonist 1559 and so they took the plymouth colony prototype 1560 and they turned it into something far far bigger 1561 on a far bigger scale 1562 which is where you find yourself with the founding 1563 of new boston in 1630 1564 narrator in the spring of 1630 a ship called the iarabellai 1565 the first of a massive fleet of 17 ship 1566 led by a wealthy puritan lawyer named john winthrop 1567 left yarmouth for the bay of massachusetts 1568 60 mile north of plymouth 1569 bringing 1000 wellsupplied puritan immigrant 1570 all through the spring and summer the great ship arrived 1571 by the end of july a church had been established 1572 the first church of boston 1573 by midseptember 1574 the new settlement already had a population of nearly 1000 1575 three time larger in ten week than the tiny community plymouth 1576 had gathered to itself in ten year 1577 hardman moore the size of the two group is massively different 1578 the ethos is similar they are all reformed protestant 1579 of a passionate conviction 1580 but the striking difference is the people who go to boston 1581 make an enormous fuss about the fact that 1582 they are not separating from the church of england 1583 narrator in july edward winslow paid a visit 1584 to their new sister colony 1585 whatever their theological difference he reported 1586 william bradford could take courage in knowing that 1587 the elder of the new colony had been urged 1588 to take advice of them at plymouth 1589 and to do nothing to offend them 1590 after ten harrowing year the future of a puritan new england 1591 if not aeparatist one seemed assured 1592 the pilgrim experiment in that respect at least 1593 had worked 1594 thus out of small beginning greater thing 1595 have been produced by his hand that me all thing of nothing 1596 and give being to all thing that are 1597 and a one small candle may light a thousand 1598 so the light here kindled hath shone to many 1599 yea in some sort to our whole nation 1600 let the glorious name of jehovah have all the praise 1601 hardman moore well in some way of course it is a success story 1602 because completely against the odds they survived 1603 they put down root they established a colony 1604 so in that sense it wa a success 1605 the sense in which it is poignantly not a success is 1606 i think for bradford the sense that the community 1607 he had hoped for didnt materialize in the sweet way 1608 that he had hoped it would 1609 philbrick they wanted to achieve 1610 the ultimate spiritual community on earth 1611 and that never happened 1612 narrator in 1630 not long after the founding 1613 of the colony at boston william bradford 1614 40 now and beginning his tenth year a governor 1615 sat down to write a history of plymouth plantation 1616 sensing perhaps from the moment the new settlement began 1617 how dramatically his own community would be transformed 1618 and determined to leave an account of who his people were 1619 and what had happened to them and why they mattered 1620 donegan i think for bradford the experiment wa not a success 1621 but a a historian writing for posterity 1622 he can tell the story and preserve the meaning 1623 of their vision and their implantation 1624 even a that vision is being dissipated 1625 and not being held by others he can preserve it in his history 1626 bailyn he wa aware of what wa going on around him 1627 acutely aware of thing that were happening 1628 and he wa no fool 1629 he knew that when the puritan started to arrive in 1630 1630 15000 of them the market for agricultural good 1631 wa going to boom 1632 which meant more farm farther out fresher ground 1633 that would further dissipate the religious group 1634 and even those most committed to it principle 1635 are wandering out into farm and outlying district 1636 the heart of the community wa being lost 1637 because it integrity wa personal 1638 people living together a a group praying together 1639 and sharing their belief 1640 philbrick and this is a great despair for bradford 1641 instead of his little congregation of saint 1642 he ha his best friend 1643 edward winslow moving off forming other town 1644 such a duxbury leaving the mother church 1645 oh poor plymouth how dost thou moan 1646 thy child all from thee are gone 1647 and left thou art in widow state 1648 poor helpless sad and desolate 1649 some thou hast had it is well known 1650 who sought thy good before their own 1651 but time have changed those day are gone 1652 and therefore thou art left alone 1653 to make others rich thyself are poor 1654 they are increased out of thy store 1655 but being rich they thee forsake 1656 leaving thee poor and desolate 1657 hardman moore i wonder with bradford 1658 he ha had to deal with so much human frailty 1659 so many human foible in his life a governor 1660 that perhaps the sense of being a pilgrim bound for heaven 1661 rather than a pilgrim who will reach 1662 their new jerusalem on earth is borne in on him 1663 very strongly towards the end of his life 1664 i think there may be something of that verse from hebrew 11 1665 we are pilgrim and stranger in the world 1666 come to his heart 1667 bailyn and at the end of his life in what to me is especially moving 1668 he turned to hebrew he learned hebrew 1669 he thought hed get closer to god in conversation 1670 with the sacred script 1671 anything to deepen his understanding 1672 of what wa happening 1673 though i am grown aged yet i have had a longing desire 1674 to see with my own eye 1675 something of that most ancient language and holy tongue 1676 in which the law and oracle of god were writ 1677 and in which god and angel 1678 spake to the holy patriarch of old time 1679 and what name were given to thing from the creation 1680 and though i can not attain to much herein 1681 yet i am refreshed to have seen some glimpse here of 1682 a moses saw the land of canaan from afar off 1683 my aim and desire is to see how the word and phrase 1684 lie in the holy text 1685 and to discern somewhat of the same for my own content 1686 speaking hebrew 1687 narrator he died on may 9 1657 1688 having outlived all his contemporary 1689 and having served a governor for 31 of the 37 year 1690 he had lived in the new world 1691 lamented his first biographer 1692 cotton mather later said by all the colony of new england 1693 a a common blessing and father to them all 1694 he wa 67 year old 1695 his body wa buried on the summit of burial hill 1696 near the grave of his mentor william brewster 1697 and in sight of the sand hill of cape cod 1698 in the year to come the world his people had come to 1699 in search of a new jerusalem would be transformed utterly 1700 with shocking rapidity and the pilgrim experience 1701 itself all but carried under and forgotten 1702 within 15 year of his death 1703 there were 70000 english settler in 110 town 1704 along the new england coast 1705 and fewer than 20000 native american left 1706 in half a dozen tribe and only at most 1000 wampanoag 1707 in 1675 massasoit own son metacom 1708 called phillip by the settler 1709 helped lead a desperate last ditch effort 1710 to drive the english colonist from their territory 1711 before their world wa obliterated completely 1712 bruchac in the aftermath of king philip war 1713 a day of thanksgiving wa declared to celebrate 1714 that king philip wa now dead and his head wa stuck 1715 on a pole in the middle of plymouth 1716 which i think is why native people instituted 1717 a day of mourning at thanksgiving 1718 because had the plymouth colonist not survived 1719 later colonization might not have happened 1720 without those coastal settlement 1721 that created a toehold and dug in 1722 and once they were there it wa impossible to extricate them 1723 narrator a time went on the manuscript william bradford 1724 had left to his son and heir on his deathbed 1725 wa carefully handed down in the family 1726 from one generation to the next 1727 until a century after his death it found it way 1728 into the library of the old south church in boston 1729 it wa still there in 1767 when the last royal governor 1730 of the colony thomas hutchinson 1731 consulted it for a history he wa writing after which 1732 the revolution came 1733 and the manuscript vanished into thin air 1734 donegan and so bradford book wa lost 1735 it wa taken from there in 1777 by the british 1736 during the revolutionary war 1737 and people tried to recover it people tried to find it 1738 people tried to trace it 1739 and nobody knew what had happened to their history 1740 their great gospel of the founding of the nation 1741 narrator for 80 year following independence 1742 the missing bradford text wa lamented 1743 by scholar in the north 1744 a the shadow of american history lengthened 1745 and a a bitter sectional dispute 1746 between north and south intensified 1747 fought in part over whether the nation deepest root 1748 lay in slaveholding virginia or puritan new england 1749 lepore there this tremendous battle in the 19th century 1750 between new england historian and virginia historian 1751 about which is the first american settlement 1752 jamestown or plymouth 1753 narrator all hope of the book recovery had been lost 1754 when in 1855 a scholar browsing in a bookstore in boston 1755 chanced upon a recently published english history 1756 of the anglican church in america 1757 and his eye fell on an unmistakable quotation 1758 from the missing bradford journal 1759 excited inquiry revealed that the long lost manuscript 1760 had somehow found it way no one knew how 1761 into the library of the bishop of london at fulham palace 1762 the bishop refused to surrender the manuscript 1763 but consented to have a handwritten copy made 1764 and sent back to boston where it wa published in 1856 1765 spawning a prewar pilgrim craze across the north 1766 on the eve of the bloodiest war in american history 1767 in the midst of which a the death toll mounted 1768 abraham lincoln established the last thursday in november 1769 a a national day of thanksgiving 1770 in honor of the pilgrim father and by the end of which 1771 the pilgrim narrative had been officially anointed 1772 a the true founding moment of america 1773 donegan eventually they petitioned to bring the book back to america 1774 that petition wa granted 1775 and when the text itself returned 1776 it wa a scriptural event 1777 and it came back with such ceremony and such gratitude 1778 and such honor that the history wa coming home again 1779 so it wa another kind of plantation 1780 it wa reimplanting that first history back in it home 1781 and nationalizing that story 1782 narrator in the spring of 1897 1783 the little manuscript bound in brittle vellum 1784 wa finally brought home again 1785 for the first time in 120 year 1786 and installed with great fanfare 1787 in the statehouse of the commonwealth of massachusetts 1788 in boston in a ceremony attended by dozen 1789 of prominent politician and dignitary 1790 in a long and rousing keynote speech 1791 senator george hoare extolled william bradford journal 1792 a a work unequaled in the annals of human history 1793 since the story of bethlehem 1794 and his final word ringing through the statehouse 1795 brought the packed assembly to it foot 1796 massachusetts he called out will preserve it until the time 1797 shall come that her child are unworthy of it 1798 and that time shall come never 1799 the pilgrim story wa complete 1800 the journey wa over and the pilgrim themselves 1801 250 year on had prevailed 1802 somewhere william bradford might have smiled 1803 bradford but them a place did god provide 1804 in wilderness and did them guide 1805 unto the american shore 1806 where they made way for many more 1807 they broke the ice themselves alone 1808 and so became a stepping stone 1809 for all others who in like case 1810 were glad to find a resting place 1811 bird squawking 1812 man now

would he speak 6 would he tell u everything at once 7 would he have an angel bring heavenly book to earth 8 if god could speak would we understand 9 would his language be so far beyond u 10 would his intention be impossible to see 11 when god speaks what doe he say 12 the bible a revelation of the character 13 and the will of god 14 it tell u who he is and how we can live 15 in a relationship with him 16 thats the primary thrust i think of the bible 17 it interesting the bible start in eden 18 and it end in eden so it all about living 19 in a relationship with him and what that look like 20 when we ask the question what the bible is 21 the best way to say it is the bible 22 is god written relation to his people 23 now god reveals himself in all kind of way 24 and he actually speaks in way outside the bible 25 in day of old to prophet and to the people of god 26 and so youd hear the voice of the lord 27 and call it the word of the lord 28 but over time that became inscripturated 29 became written down into his word 30 and over time weve collected the book 31 that contain those word into 66 smaller book 32 that collectively we call the bible 33 the bible is a collection of divinelyinspired text 34 that document not only what god ha done throughout history 35 but also what that mean 36 so it interprets what those event mean 37 you have a book written by 40some author 38 over 1500plus year and dozen of different topic 39 that have absolute unity 40 most of the people didnt know each other who wrote it 41 so it ha amazing unity within great diversity 42 which is best accounted for by deity 43 but here we have this grand narrative that is meant 44 to bring u back into fellowship with him 45 to bring u into a harmonious fellowship with one another 46 where we live together reflecting his character 47 and ultimately a redeemed humanity 48 in a new heaven and a new earth 49 here is the one who made u addressing u about how 50 life should be lived and how we should approach life 51 it full of wisdom 52 it full of discernment 53 it full of direction and guidance 54 in some case correction 55 and so i think to get a good look at who we really are 56 a people the image and metaphor thats used about 57 the bible is that it a good mirror 58 it help u to see thing a they really are 59 i often tell people that one of the way 60 that i know that the bible is true 61 is the way that it diagnosis my sin 62 im often reading through a passage and im thinking 63 this wa written 3000 year ago 64 and yet it perfectly diagnosis the state 65 of the sin of my heart 66 how could human being have been able to do that 67 and the only way that can happen is if my creator 68 is actually the author of the book 69 we read book so that we might understand them 70 but when we read the bible we realize that it is describing 71 who we are and what we are 72 it also unique in that it provides the only satisfying 73 answer to the question of our human existence 74 it tell u why were here and where were going 75 and why it matter 76 you need god specifically in propositional language 77 telling u certain fact about reality including himself 78 you can get some of those fact from nature 79 but you cant get all of them 80 you cant get that god is triune 81 you cant get the plan of salvation from the star 82 you can only get it from special revelation 83 so if were gon na be saved and sanctified 84 we need the scripture 85 the study of the word of god at any level 86 is the study of god himself 87 there some kind of identity between god and his word 88 and yet to say that the study of the word 89 a word and proposition on a page 90 is not an end in itself because it to drive u to christ 91 to god himself 92 in the upper room in the great intercessory prayer 93 jesus prayed for the sanctification of his disciple 94 and he said sanctify them by thy word 95 thats the mean by which we are sanctified 96 then he went on to say thy word is truth 97 so the scripture should dominate 98 everything that the church doe 99 it shouldnt be an aside to what the church doe 100 the foundation of what the church should do 101 should be about advancing the message of scripture 102 where you find a healthy biblical church 103 by definition youre going to find a church happily 104 faithfully living under the authority of that word 105 understanding that the most historic formula 106 for the christian church ha been this 107 when the scripture speaks god speaks 108 and if you understand that rightly 109 then everything else simply fall into place 110 language is an incredible mystery really 111 what is it that make human being 112 able to communicate in word 113 personally i think that is the image of god in u 114 because god speaks right at the beginning of the bible 115 god spoke the world into existence 116 you know you think about word and whether or not 117 their important and we realize we cant even have 118 a conversation without word 119 whats really interesting is that we cant 120 even think to ourselves without word 121 we cant explain ourselves to ourselves without word 122 now thats either an accident of evolutionary biology 123 and development or it is evidence 124 to the fact that god made u in his image 125 and so here the bible tell u that we are 126 god creature made in his image 127 and what distinguishes u from other creature 128 well at least in part the use of word 129 and because he made himself accessible 130 through speaking to u and through the display 131 of his character in what he made 132 he made himself accessible that mean that truth 133 also is accessible 134 now that includes ordinary truth like two plus two 135 is equal to four but it also includes the truth 136 about who god is that he everlasting 137 that he all powerful that he supremely good 138 so for god to speak is for god to engage 139 in selfrevelation we only know god 140 because god ha condescended to speak to u 141 so one of the first thing we say about god 142 is that he is a speaking god 143 we would not know him except that he speaks to u 144 and the beautiful thing really 145 what make life worth living and give u 146 the ability to with hope with joy 147 with tenacity make it through the valley of life 148 is the fact that the eternal god who created u 149 can be personally known 150 he with u and according to one passage of scripture 151 in hebrew chapter 13 if we will commit our life to him 152 he will never never leave u or forsake u 153 the bible is essentially god selfrevelation 154 and god doesnt just reveal himself 155 in term of what you must do 156 that is the consequence of who he is 157 and the way in which he want u to understand his world 158 if god created u 159 then he set the term of his revelation 160 what we know when we know it how it is revealed 161 it all dependent on him 162 but it seems so strange 163 an eternal god tying himself to human history 164 illustrating his character in law prophecy and wisdom 165 what happens when he appears 166 when he step down into history and speaks 167 you know the question that always exists in people mind 168 is simply this what is god like 169 and are there many god or is there one god 170 of course left on our own all of these are mystery 171 what you have at sinai is very remarkable 172 you find for example that the people were to stand back 173 god say stand back 174 no animal wa even to touch the mountain 175 if an animal touched the mountain 176 it wa to be put to death but not directly 177 with the human hand it wa to be shot with an arrow 178 because god say im coming stand back 179 get out of the way 180 what god wa revealing there wa his holiness 181 so when we think of the 10 commandment 182 they were not simply given for a certain point in time 183 they really are let me use the word omnitemporal 184 by that i mean they exist a the basic law of god 185 throughout all era 186 and god is really saying in the 10 commandment 187 this is what im like 188 and so there no other word 189 like them in all of scripture 190 jesus speaks in the new testament god 191 but nowhere else doe god thunder word 192 to the entire congregation of the people of god 193 these obviously are of fundamental importance 194 to god covenant with these people 195 god speaks in an audible voice to the people 196 but then he writes it down in the 10 commandment 197 in written form it wa written the first time 198 by the very finger of god god himself did the writing 199 thats hammering home the fact that this original writing 200 wa the very word of god and had the authority 201 of the same god who spoke in thunder and fire 202 at mount sinai but that written form of the 10 commandment 203 wa the first piece of what we call canon 204 that is it the body of thing that god set aside 205 of his own word for impermanent form 206 there some thing that god said that he said 207 to particular people and they werent recorded 208 in written form for posterity 209 thats okay there are many thing for instance 210 in jesus earthly life that he taught 211 not all of those have been written down 212 it would be overwhelming if we had all of those 213 but god purposed that there would be a selection 214 of those thing that would be there in permanent form 215 if god wrote a book 216 would it be a history book 217 the transcendent being interacting with creature 218 who are separated by sin distanced by unbelief 219 what would he write about these people 220 would bh paint grand picture 221 would he hide the embarrassing detail 222 is human experience beyond him 223 it been said that the bible is not a book 224 that man would write if he could write 225 or could write if he would write 226 every now and then ill be in a debate 227 at a university and someone will say 228 well the old testament is merely proisraeli 229 zionistic propaganda 230 it just the jewish people were trying 231 to feel good about who they were 232 but that claim fall apart upon closer look 233 at the content because look youve got 234 one of the greatest king of israel david 235 wa an adulterer 236 abraham twice lied about the identity of his wife 237 so one of the thing that bear the ring of truth 238 is the thing that we probably would have excluded 239 had the bible been a merely human invention 240 the sin the foible the failure 241 of many of the bible great figure 242 we probably would have left out 243 the bible appeal to prophecy and fulfillment 244 before and after all of that depends 245 on historical progress on continuity 246 on the sequence of time 247 so god himself doubtless inhabits eternity 248 and is in some sense above space and time 249 in that sense he transcendent 250 thats what we mean by transcendent 251 not limited by space and time 252 yet at the same time he discloses himself to u 253 in space and time that is to say in history 254 now one of the thing to understand about the bible 255 is that it talk about god plan through the age 256 and we call it redemptive history 257 and the bible is intrinsically 258 connected to that in two way 259 one is that it give a lot of attention to explaining 260 how god wa dealing with the human race 261 from creation onwards the fall into sin 262 and then various period of redemption 263 so it talk about redemptive history 264 but the second way is that it given 265 progressively in history 266 god didnt have it just drop from heaven 267 at one point in time 268 there some people who practically treat it 269 a if it wa that way it is a book from god 270 but it a book where he address people 271 where they are in history 272 and he doesnt reveal everything all at once 273 his plan of redemption keep pace 274 with his speaking about redemption 275 redemptive history move forward 276 through prophet priest and king 277 to an ultimate prophet priest and king 278 but people need proof 279 how can we be confident that jesus is the fulfillment 280 how do we see it the way his 281 earliest follower would see it 282 when jesus came and the disciple preached 283 there wasnt a new testament to appeal to 284 they were dealing with promise that were coming 285 out of the old testament tied to the great covenant 286 the covenant of abraham that god wa gon na bless 287 the world through abraham family 288 the covenant to david that there would be a king 289 and a line of king that would represent the way of god 290 and then finally the new covenant 291 the idea that god wa gon na write his law on our heart 292 put his spirit within u and that we were gon na do that 293 in the context of having our sin forgiven 294 and the story of jesus step into those promise 295 made century before and address really the reconnecting 296 of god to u in what had been a broken relationship 297 you know the very first book of the new testament 298 matthew open with the genealogy of jesus 299 and the purpose of that genealogy is to affirm 300 that jesus is the fulfillment 301 of the whole old testament story 302 it crafted very we could go into detail 303 but there not time very carefully crafted 304 to show that he fulfills the whole history of israel 305 the whole story of the old testament 306 a we look through the new testament 307 i mean he fulfills everything in the old testament 308 he is the revelation of god that fulfills 309 god revelation in moses and brings it to it completion 310 he is the lamb slain from the foundation of the world 311 the lamb of god who take away the sin of the world 312 that fulfills all the old sacrificial system 313 in the old testament 314 i would imagine that jesus probably knew the whole 315 old testament off by heart so that when he then 316 in the synagogue in nazareth say you know 317 this is about me 318 he is able too say this is about me because he know 319 what this is about and that the prophecy of isaiah 320 wa revealing who and what the messiah truly is 321 i would talk about these prophecy and a professor 322 would say well i dont believe this ever happened 323 i dont think these prophecy in the old testament 324 were written down until jesus wa born 325 and then they were written out so they 326 would coincide with his life 327 i said wow 328 thats amazing that sound pretty good 329 unless you wan na think 330 i would say look if you say there not a 500year gap 331 minimum from the completion of the old testament 332 and the time of christ i said you got a problem 333 with the septuagint the greek translation 334 of the hebrew old testament documented in history 335 that wa initiated right around 250 year before christ 336 well first of all the septuagint is the ancient 337 translation of the hebrew scripture into greek 338 it wa probably the first translation made 339 of the hebrew scripture 340 it wa begun in the third century before christ 341 with the pentateuch being translated 342 probably in alexandria egypt 343 tradition ha it that there were about 70 translator 344 so it wa the bible of greekspeaking judaism 345 before christ came and because greek wa the lingua franca 346 of the mediterranean world when the apostle go out 347 to preach the gospel they naturally preach in greek 348 because their language aramaic probably 349 wasnt widely used outside of firstcentury palestine 350 if the old testament is composed of 39 book 351 written across hundred of year 352 from a diversity of author how do we know 353 that these are the book that god intended 354 would jesus even recognize 355 the old testament we hold in our hand 356 the book that were being discussed a possibly 357 a part of the old testament canon by the time 358 we get to the first century are book like lamentation 359 song of song ecclesiastes work like that 360 and maybe a few other work that end up showing up 361 in what we call the apocrypha 362 wisdom sirrac those kind of work 363 but the work that everyone recognizes were seen 364 a inspired and a part of the jewish scripture at the time 365 include the torah the first five book 366 proverb psalm your major prophet 367 most of your minor prophet and so 368 if we dont know the exact limit of the old testament canon 369 in the first century which is possible 370 it may be that it wa already decided by then 371 thats also conceivable 372 that which is being excluded doesnt really represent 373 any significant portion of the text 374 that the new testament interacting with 375 we all know now that if we have catholic friend 376 their bible will generally be bigger than ours 377 because they contain a number of book in the old testament 378 book of maccabees for example 379 that protestant book exclude 380 and theyre excluded by and large on the ground 381 that we dont find them in the hebrew 382 they dont seem to have the kind of longstanding 383 universal acceptance within the church 384 prior to say the council of trent 385 that one expects from canonical book 386 one of the primary reason we dont use those book 387 or dont view those book a scripture 388 is because jesus and the apostle did not use those book 389 or view those book a scripture 390 thats a very basic way of putting it 391 if those book indeed were viewed a scripture 392 and that people were using them widely a scripture 393 and they were considered part of the old testament canon 394 we would have expected jesus and the apostle somewhere 395 sometime at least once using at least one of those book 396 a scripture and the fact is 397 we dont see that even a single time 398 they were respected and utilized because 399 they were regarded a helpful jewish source of material 400 and information particularly about 401 what wa called the maccabean war 402 in the case of the historical apocryphal book 403 which is a very traumatic period in israel history 404 when she wa almost wiped out by antiochus epiphanes 405 and had the jew not won the maccabean war 406 we may not have judaism today 407 it might have been extinguished from the earth 408 it true that some of the apocryphal book 409 are found bound within some of the biblical manuscript 410 but not all of them and not in every codex 411 and i dont think that that necessarily entail 412 that they must be canonical 413 if you look at our bible today weve got 414 between the cover called the holy bible 415 weve got essay weve got map 416 weve got index weve got reader resource 417 weve got study note on the bottom of the page 418 there lot of material in our modern bible 419 that none of u would consider canonical or inspired 420 it noteworthy for example that jesus disagrees 421 with the pharisee and sadducee over a number 422 of different issue theologically and doctrinally 423 they debate all kind of thing all throughout 424 the page of the gospel but one of the thing 425 thats noteworthy is they never debate about 426 which book belong in the canon 427 and which book do not belong in the canon 428 jesus refers to the scripture and the pharisee 429 seem to understand what book he talking about 430 jesus refers to the old testament writing 431 sadducee seem to be fairly content that we all agree 432 on which book are in and which book are out 433 there no oddity of them saying 434 well youre quoting from a book thats not in the canon 435 and jesus never say that to a pharisee or a sadducee 436 and there seems to be every good reason to think 437 that that issue wa relatively settled in the time of jesus 438 you know of course one of the most favored verse 439 in all the bible is john 11 where it say 440 in the beginning wa the word 441 the greek word is logo 442 we could say in the beginning wa logic 443 and why is that word used and applied to jesus 444 a john later say in verse 14 the word became flesh 445 first of all because the word had a great meaning 446 in those day and there some debate a to 447 whether or not it based on the greek or other meaning 448 but here the idea jesus is the logic 449 and the intelligibility of god 450 the word signifies god selfdisclosure 451 the word is god selfrevelation 452 it how god make himself known 453 so it profound and immensely significant 454 and actually quite logical that christ would be called 455 the word made flesh because now visibly 456 before our eye we have the revelation of god himself 457 a much a i love the book of hebrew 458 if i were marooned on a desert island 459 and could only have one biblical book 460 it would be one of the gospel 461 because it there we meet jesus 462 it there that the narrative the story the account 463 of the actual incarnation of the son of god take place 464 so he sent his son a the godman 465 just a much man a if hed never been god 466 and just a much god a if hed never been man 467 so that we could see and hear in a way that we could 468 comprehend the truth of god very heart and mind 469 in order that you might know that the son of man 470 ha authority on earth to forgive sin 471 i say to you get up and walk 472 he doe something that you can see 473 and link it to something you cant see 474 you cant see forgiveness of sin 475 you can see someone being healed 476 and if that guy get up and walk his walk talk 477 and it say the son of man ha authority 478 on earth to forgive sin 479 and then the context for that remark is 480 but no one can forgive sin but god 481 and word are cheap i mean they i can utter it 482 and you know then youre left with the choice 483 of whether to believe it or not 484 but if i can show it if i can compellingly demonstrate 485 that what im claiming might have you know 486 some avenue to the truth and be reflective 487 of whats going on thats a more powerful way to do it 488 so the bible call the miracle that jesus doe 489 thing like sign or power 490 those are the word that are used to describe the miracle 491 and the miracle are really what i call powerpoints 492 theyre audiovisual to a truth about who jesus is 493 that show his power and authority 494 i love the beginning of the gospel of mark 495 where jesus stand forward and he say 496 the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is at hand 497 repent and believe the good news 498 because there had been 400 year essentially 499 of silence in the intertestamental period 500 john the baptist had stepped forward 501 and he wa pointing the way and it wa all pregnant 502 for the appearing of this one and the very fact 503 that mark begin by jesus reaching into the old 504 in order to put himself in the present 505 is so wonderfully helpful 506 for him to unroll the isaiah scroll 507 and explain today this is fulfilled in your hearing 508 speaks of his own messianic identity and mission 509 but also suggests that he ha studied the scripture 510 someone had taught them to him 511 and he saw fit to announce his own mission and ministry 512 with a reference to the bible 513 if anyone could have just announced it me 514 you dont need to read that dusty book anymore 515 that old scroll it would have been jesus 516 but he never did that because he understood 517 that his ministry wa an extension and a fulfilling 518 but never an abolishing or an eradicating 519 i remember when i wa in bible college 520 i said to myself i can believe in the new testament 521 but it hard for me to believe in the old testament 522 and then i realized something 523 i cant believe le than jesus believed 524 and he had absolute confidence in the old testament 525 there no debate about what his view of scripture wa 526 he say you know his word is true thy word is truth 527 he said that not one jot or tittle will pas away 528 to all this will he got jot and tittle inspiration 529 is what he taught 530 he never set scripture aside 531 what he did wa to make very clear 532 that he perfectly fulfilled scripture 533 and of course he went beyond even the old testament law 534 in the sermon on the mount saying youve heard it said 535 and he never revers it he never minimizes it 536 instead he go even beyond it 537 youve heard it said you shall not commit adultery 538 i will tell you that if youve lusted in your heart 539 you have already committed adultery 540 our popular evangelical understanding 541 of jesus and the pharisee is this 542 we think that jesus big message to the pharisee is 543 aw come on guy dont be so nitpicky 544 you will never once find jesus in the gospel 545 saying to the pharisee you care too much about the law 546 invariably jesus will say you have added to the law 547 and thus contradicted it 548 or hell say you guy make a whole lot about the law 549 but you dont really follow it 550 over and over watch him make that move 551 those are what he say 552 and what is that flowing out of 553 a rocksolid commitment to the sole final authority 554 and sufficiency of the word of god 555 what doe jesus wan na see 556 the word of god a the sole final authority 557 for faith and practice in the life of believer 558 and he saying pharisee for all the bell and whistle 559 that you attach to your teaching on the law 560 you undermine it 561 so every evidence is that jesus knew our old testament 562 the book that we have that he affirmed them a holy 563 scripture along with the other jewish people of his day 564 and that from beginning to end 565 he interpreted and understood his own life in that way 566 he is the messiah he is the fulfillment 567 of the history of god people in the old testament 568 so yes jesus very much affirmed the authority 569 of the old testament so if you deny it 570 you have to disagree with jesus 571 the new testament needed to be written because 572 the old testament hadnt completed the story 573 that the timeline and the arc of god redemptive purpose 574 reached a point where everybody if you like 575 wa standing on their tiptoe 576 to see how the thing would finish 577 and so in the way that the writer to the hebrew say 578 that god you know ha spoken in the past in various way 579 and by different prophet and so on it anticipates the fact 580 that that story will then come to completion 581 and it the new testament that doe that for u 582 in the old testament jesus is anticipated 583 and in the gospel jesus is revealed 584 in the act he preached 585 in the epistle he explained 586 so in other word everything is just pointing forward 587 to that great fulfillment which come in jesus 588 you have to understand the early jew 589 were not looking for a crucified messiah 590 they did not expect a crucified messiah 591 even isaiah 53 the great old testament text 592 thats thought to refer to this right 593 early jew didnt interpret that a a crucified messiah 594 for one thing my servant israel wa assumed 595 to be the nation of israel suffering for the sin 596 of the world not a particular individual 597 on the one hand they had to explain this to the world 598 on the other hand they had to explain this to themselves 599 because they were not expecting this 600 this wa an unexpected outcome 601 and let be clear if crucifixion wa the end 602 of jesus story there is really no good historical 603 explanation for why we have the gospel 604 or the rest of the new testament at all 605 there had to be a reversal of that final judgment 606 when you think about where the new testament came from 607 it came out of judaism 608 why would these jewish believer who thought 609 they were god chosen people 610 why would they invent a resurrected jesus 611 what motivation would they have for that 612 why would they invent this 613 it make no sense at all 614 i mean if one of them said 615 hey were gon na start a new religion 616 and one of the others said we are 617 yeah 618 well whats it gon na get u 619 well first of all were gon na 620 get kicked out of the synagogue 621 and then were gon na get beaten tortured and killed 622 you think the other guy gon na go hey great idea 623 sign me up 624 no he not gon na say that right 625 there no motivation for jew 626 to invent a resurrected jesus 627 in fact let me put it this way 628 because i hear some people out there thinking 629 that the new testament writer invented the resurrection 630 no the new testament writer did not invent 631 or create the resurrection 632 the resurrection created the new testament writer 633 there would be no new testament 634 unless there wa a resurrection 635 the resurrection is god amen to christ atoning work 636 it is the signal evidence that what jesus ha accomplished 637 ha been if you like ratified by the father 638 that what god the father if you like ha planned 639 that god the son ha procured 640 and the resurrection is the signal to the entire world 641 that the mission upon which jesus ha embarked 642 ha actually been accomplished 643 so were not just talking about a reversal of death 644 were talking about a whole new kind of life 645 that he get by mean of resurrection 646 and thats what the earliest writer about jesus 647 were trying to make clear is this is not just 648 a kindness or a mercy of god on jesus 649 no this is a vindication of who he wa 650 and of his claim and you need to pay attention now 651 the first corinthian 15 i mean that is a 652 a text that ha a robust resurrection theology 653 where paul say on multiple occasion 654 that jesus died and wa raised according to the scripture 655 according to the scripture according to the scripture 656 and he suggests that there wa a real physical 657 bodily resurrection of jesus christ from the dead 658 and without that there is no christian faith 659 in my view it is theological insanity 660 and an exegetical suicide to argue that there is 661 no real resurrection of jesus from the dead 662 it something spiritual jesus life in the heart 663 of his people that belief doe not save anybody 664 if jesus bible only consisted 665 of the old testament why do we need the new 666 when wa the story written down 667 why wa the story written down at all 668 how do sinful people write 669 the undefiled word of transcendence 670 if memory fade people exaggerate 671 and event get misinterpreted 672 if the new testament is true 673 how could we know 674 you know there a difference between 675 what happened two day ago which wa just a benign event 676 and what we call psychologically an impact event 677 an impact event is something that impact you 678 so dramatically youll never forget what happened 679 like for example where were you 680 when the second plane hit the tower 681 right right now a we record this that wa 15 year ago 682 but i can remember what happened exactly 683 i remember who i wa talking to 684 and what i wa saying and what he wa saying to me 685 and the question is do you think 686 a resurrection would have been an impact event 687 do you think if jesus really rose from the dead 688 that would have had an impact on the people that saw him 689 after he had resurrected 690 yeah they would have remembered that til their grave 691 so i dont have any doubt that even if the eyewitness 692 wrote it down 20 year later or 30 year later 693 doesnt matter they remembered it 694 the reason to not just rely on oral tradition 695 and to actually write down a gospel 696 like the earliest gospel probably the gospel of mark 697 the reason to do that is because youre losing 698 the living voice youre losing the eyewitness 699 so there is this huge impetus in the second half 700 of the first century ad to produce document 701 that would allow u to not lose the memory 702 of what jesus wa like what he did what he said 703 and what his earliest follower were like a well 704 and thats really the impetus behind the writing 705 of the new testament and when they got busy with it 706 they got busy with it between about 49 and about 100 707 all 27 document of the new testament 708 seem to have been written 709 when we think in term of authorship of the bible 710 we have essentially a dual authorship 711 so it true to say that paul wrote roman 712 it equally true to say that god wrote roman 713 and the great wonder of it is that without any violation 714 of paul personality or his intellect 715 god through the instrumentation of the holy spirit 716 both provided paul and enabled paul to write a he wrote 717 and that would be true for all the bible author 718 when david writes psalm 23 it not a if he came in 719 after a hard day work and wa about to fall asleep 720 when a voice spoke to him out of the gloom and said 721 not yet david pick up your stylus 722 ive got some dictation for you 723 and then god said the lord the lord 724 is my is my shepherd shepherd 725 i shall lack nothing i shall lack nothing 726 there no way in god green earth 727 that psalm 23 wa written that way 728 it wa spoken out of the fullness of david experience 729 both a a believer and a a shepherd 730 and he thought about these thing turned them over 731 in his mind and he picked up his stylus and he wrote 732 nevertheless scripture insists that god so worked 733 through such form of inspiration that the result 734 wa nonetheless the word of god 735 i think on the other end of that spectrum 736 perhaps we also cant get too loose between the text 737 of scripture and the meaning of scripture 738 that those word really are there for a reason 739 and theyre not dictated but that doesnt mean 740 that we can just kind of loosely paraphrase 741 or understand the text 742 that we do have to respect what 743 the biblical author actually wrote 744 of course the christian claim from the start 745 is that this is a supernatural event 746 we dont believe that it just happened to work out 747 that human being wrote down perfect word 748 or that they just tried a lot and eventually got it right 749 or something like this no we believe that god 750 superintended the whole process by his holy spirit 751 and this is why a common complaint by nonchristians 752 and by critic of christianity often miss the point 753 people would say well you cant believe the bible 754 is the word of god because it wa written by men 755 but of course that presumes the nonchristian view 756 of the way it happened 757 thats not the christian claim 758 the christian claim is that wasnt just that it wa 759 written by men our claim is that it wa written 760 by men who were carried along by the holy spirit 761 and it that second step thats so key 762 behind your doctrine of scripture is the doctrine of god 763 and behind the product of scripture is the activity of god 764 the scripture is the product of god the holy spirit 765 which is why god the holy spirit us it in conversion 766 and in sanctification 767 so what we believe about the bible 768 is based on what we believe about it source 769 and because we believe god to be the author of the bible 770 we talk about the quality of the bible a inspired 771 or godbreathed 772 paul letter were written somewhere between 773 about 49 and maybe 63 or 64 ad 774 not a big timeline 775 but thats almost half the new testament 776 13 of the document of the new testament are attributed 777 to paul and they are by consensus the earliest 778 new testament document 779 so we dont have any document that are today 780 part of the new testament from before about 49 781 even the atheist admit that paul is writing 782 first corinthian in about 55 ad and we can date that 783 from an archeological discovery in delphi in greece 784 and we can date all of paul missionary journey 785 from that archeological inscription 786 and were almost certain that paul is writing 787 first corinthian in either 55 or 56 ad 788 i think collin hemmers work who is a roman historian 789 i dont even think he wa a christian 790 he wrote a book called back in the late 80 791 called act in the setting of helenistic history 792 in which he make in my view a very persuasive case 793 that act the book of act had to be written by 62 ad 794 in fact he give a number of reason in the book 795 if act is 62 ad that mean luke ha to be prior to act 796 because act is luke second work 797 and then if luke is written say sometime in the 50 798 it appears that luke maybe one of his source is mark 799 which mean mark is prior to luke so youre very early now 800 youre in the early 50 maybe 40 801 so the bulk of the new testament is said to be written 802 from the end of the 40 49 thereabouts 803 all the way up to the last decade of the first century 804 and youre dealing with a period 805 of about 50 year from start to finish 806 i would say that mark is our earliest gospel 807 that yes matthew and luke used the vast majority of mark 808 there 95 percent of mark is in matthew gospel 809 but matthew wa not just copying mark 810 he added another 50 percent to his document 811 from various other source 812 so he wa using a variety of source 813 to produce his document 814 and under the inspiration of god each one wanted 815 to present a slightly different portrait of jesus 816 it not a if let say matthew say 817 that jesus is the king in the line of david 818 he emphasizes that even in the beginning of his gospel 819 is that incompatible with john who emphasizes 820 that jesus is the revelation of god the father 821 well no theyre both true right 822 but theyre complementary 823 whats hard for people to remember is 824 is that when you wrote a gospel and you did it 825 on a running scroll of papyrus if you wan na think about 826 it that way there a certain length that 827 oftentimes is the maximum that you can deal with 828 and particularly when we get into matthew luke 829 and john our longer gospel 830 theyre running up into those limit 831 and so that impact how much detail they communicate 832 about the story that they present 833 still another issue is in recorded speech 834 because some people expect that recorded speech 835 will be verbatim accurate 836 it will be like a court stenographer 837 who just take down every word exactly 838 if we did most preaching class 839 and used the sermon on the mount a an example 840 most of our church service would be very short 841 because you can read through the sermon on the mount 842 in five to seven minute 843 what we know is that jesus spoke to people all day 844 and you know when you bring a crowd out from the city 845 to come sit in the field and listen to a teacher 846 he isnt speaking for just five to seven minute 847 so there are case where you may not be getting always 848 the exact word of jesus you may be getting a summary 849 of something that he actually spent a much longer time 850 talking about and you may be getting snippet of that 851 or a summary of that thats boiled down into 852 you know into a packageable length 853 given everything else thats going on in the gospel 854 we need to stop thinking about the gospel 855 a if they were like modern photograph 856 theyre not 857 theyre like portrait 858 and portrait are inherently interpretive 859 theyre not just history they are interpreted history 860 history from a particular theological and ethical angle 861 and this is true of all four gospel 862 it not just true about john which is highly theological 863 all four gospel provide u with a theological 864 interpretation of the historical figure jesus 865 and we may be thankful to have four of them 866 that have difference of angle of incidence 867 and yet recognizably it the same person 868 remember ancient biography 869 their issue wa characterization 870 who is this person a revealed by his word and deed 871 thats what theyre trying to get at 872 one of the big challenge in biblical study today 873 is the very subtle suggestion that well it the 874 theological teaching of the bible that are inspired 875 and whether any of those historical narrative 876 that the teaching come out of whether they ever happened 877 or not it really doesnt matter 878 i wan na argue thats absolutely wrong 879 it doe matter 880 the fundamental divide on the issue of inspiration 881 is whether it is subjective or objective 882 when i wa a first year phd student in edinburgh 883 scotland the very first debate that i witnessed 884 at the university of edinburgh wa a debate 885 on the topic of the inspiration of the old testament 886 and a liberal old testament scholar 887 and an evangelical were going to have a debate 888 and the moderator first question to both of them wa 889 how do you define inspiration 890 and dr alls said well i believe that the bible 891 is inspired because it inspires me 892 now that is a classic subjective definition 893 of inspiration in other word whatever inspiration is 894 doesnt reside in scripture itself 895 it resides in it effect on or in me 896 whereas the bible claim an objective inspiration 897 listen again to paul word all scripture is godbreathed 898 it not something that ha been put into scripture 899 it not something that scripture doe to me 900 it is something that is inherent in scripture 901 because of where it come from 902 peter in particular draw this contrast 903 between myth just story fable legend 904 versus eyewitness account 905 he say we saw this 906 we didnt make up a story to make you feel better 907 were not just giving you you know 908 the spirit of christmas or the inspiration of easter 909 i wa on the mountain i saw jesus christ transfigured 910 in glory these are thing we saw with our eye 911 we heard with our ear they happened 912 you can count on them and that set the bible apart 913 from almost everything else in the ancient world 914 and it religious pantheon of god and goddess 915 because this good news is rooted in history 916 something that happened 917 and based on a future that we know then will happen 918 one of the remarkable thing about the gospel 919 that we have in our new testament 920 a well a the whole bible is that the bible 921 subject itself to historical verification 922 it put itself at risk of inquiry 923 unlike the gospel of thomas unlike the koran 924 unlike the bhagavad gita or the teaching 925 of the compassionate buddha that are talkinghead theology 926 the bible say jesus did this at a certain place 927 here the guy name whom he healed 928 or here the house where he did it at 929 like in mark two where you had these four men 930 who lift part of the thatched roof at peter house 931 and they drop this paralyzed man right in front of jesus 932 and he heals the man and he walk out 933 ive been to peter house it in coppernium 934 on the shore of the sea of galilee 935 you can see the very place where jesus stood 936 when he wa lecturing to this crowd that wa packed 937 and the actual door that this man walked out of 938 thats historically verifiable stuff 939 you dont have that in these other document 940 a faith rooted in history 941 a revelation coming through human instrument 942 a religion spreading through the entire region and beyond 943 but we wonder who wrote these book 944 how did they spread 945 can we be confident they are the actual word 946 that god meant for u to have 947 the question of authorship is a common one 948 if were gon na rely on these book 949 we wan na know who wrote them 950 we wan na know when they were written and whether we should 951 listen to the person who name are attached to them 952 many people doubt whether we can know those thing 953 i dont think those thing are out of the range of knowing 954 in fact we have a tremendously good amount of evidence 955 about the author of these book 956 and there all kind of way we know who wrote these book 957 certainly the title attached to these book are a key part 958 of that evidence that go back very very early 959 when we look at the gospel themselves for example 960 we know those title were attached probably by the end 961 of the first century if not the early second century 962 there a secondcentury impulse that begin 963 that say add the name of an apostle to a book 964 to make sure that we know that it really is by that person 965 those kind of thing we see in these apocryphal book 966 the gospel of thomas the gospel of phillip of mary 967 of juda all these work ascribe authorship in the text 968 not a a title above it but actually in the text 969 the new testament gospel dont do that 970 they were originally anonymous i believe 971 the ancient church father were unanimous that mark 972 got his gospel from the apostle peter 973 and mark wa a follower of paul an associate of paul 974 to start with but he got his gospel from peter 975 if you have this apostolic authorship impulse 976 why isnt the gospel of mark ever 977 ever called the gospel of peter 978 it isnt 979 so that apostolic authorship impulse is not something 980 thats intrinsic to the new testament 981 it intrinsic to pseudepigrapha apocryphal book 982 book that came later 983 and guy like bart erman who wrote this book forged 984 about the book that were not really written 985 by the people that we think they were 986 he try to argue for this apostolic authorship impulse 987 in the first century 988 if thats the case 989 why dont we have it for the gospel of mark 990 did jesus change over the first 991 three hundred year of the church 992 the depiction of jesus 993 and when you look at people who followed the apostle 994 clement papias irenaeus these type of individual 995 justin martyr these folk when you look at their writing 996 you see theyre given the same basic data 997 that the new testament writer gave 998 so you have this chain of custody 999 going through the first three century of the church 1000 before we have say the first full copy of 1001 say the new testament or the old testament 1002 early christianity wa basically an evangelistic movement 1003 which is distinctive in early judaism 1004 the other early jewish movement like the kumran community 1005 or john the baptizer they were not evangelistic 1006 in the sense that they were going out and getting recruit 1007 that were nonjews 1008 this is something pretty distinctive about early 1009 christianity is a it wa a missionary movement 1010 and b it went after gentile deliberately by intention 1011 so in that kind of environment they needed some tool 1012 to do a better job evangelizing and teaching 1013 in those kind of environment 1014 and so the impetus to generate source 1015 of important material to convince both jew 1016 and gentile about jesus wa paramount 1017 when it come to the new testament writing 1018 author not only had to write a book 1019 and then people would read that book 1020 but eventually that book had to be copied 1021 and then transmitted over time 1022 obviously this wa before the printing press 1023 this wa before you could go down to your copy machine 1024 and run off a few copy and so if people wanted 1025 their book to be spread far and wide 1026 if people wanted their book to be published so to speak 1027 that book had to be copied 1028 i would reckon it would take somebody oh 1029 a good three or four hour to just take dictation 1030 for a document like roman and then on top of that 1031 youd have to produce a fairhand copy 1032 thats the one that would be given 1033 so from the start there would be two copy 1034 the one that the scribe and the author retained 1035 and the one that wa sent to whoever the recipient 1036 of the document are 1037 it is a laborious process 1038 you know if it wa me my hand would have fallen off 1039 about halfway through the job at best 1040 they and they had to be clear 1041 because without punctuation and division of word 1042 the capital letter had to be absolutely clear 1043 a to what they are and somebody 1044 knew where to divide the word right 1045 so it an expensive process 1046 the longest usable scroll that wa still wieldy 1047 of some sort would be no more than about 35 foot long 1048 and when taking the average sized lettering 1049 what that mean is it could only contain one gospel 1050 the gospel of luke the book of act 1051 would be right around 28 foot long by those estimate 1052 you couldnt put luke and another gospel in there 1053 just luke or just act 1054 this is why luke himself wrote both 1055 of these book a separate volume 1056 they almost surely were written at the same time 1057 but because of the material that wa used 1058 namely papyrus scroll they couldnt be 1059 bound together a a single book 1060 the number two manuscript authority 1061 in history is the iliad by homer 1062 more manuscript are being discovered of homer 1063 than any other classical work 1064 and right now we have about a thousand 1065 see the moment i make this statement it obsolete 1066 1820some manuscript of the iliad by homer 1067 but when it come to this bible now and this is incredible 1068 it hard to grasp i can now document 1069 66000 manuscript and scroll of the bible 1070 66000 1071 the manuscript are divided between two different group 1072 those that are written in the original language greek 1073 and those that are written in other language 1074 or translation of the greek into other language 1075 and those are typically called version 1076 the vast majority of these are not complete new testament 1077 we only have about 60 that are 1078 complete new testament manuscript 1079 but the vast majority of them also are very large 1080 the average greek new testament manuscript 1081 is more than 450 page long 1082 so theyre big text 1083 and we have well over two million page 1084 of greek manuscript handwritten manuscript 1085 from before the time of the printing press 1086 and they come pretty early on 1087 starting in the second century 1088 we have a many a a dozen manuscript 1089 the earliest to date is still considered p52 1090 which is at manchester university in manchester england 1091 p52 still stand today a one of our earliest 1092 new testament manuscript maybe even still the earliest 1093 dated around 100 to 125 ad 1094 and it a little fragment of john 18 1095 once that manuscript wa discovered 1096 they realized that the dating of john 1097 had to be much earlier than even that manuscript 1098 which ended up putting the dating 1099 well into the first century 1100 so it just a small fragment 1101 it about the size of a credit card 1102 but it prof that the gospel of john 1103 existed before that time 1104 and for almost 100 year up until then 1105 there wa european scholarship that argued 1106 that the gospel of john could not have been written 1107 before 160 and should have been written at about 170 1108 when this scrap of papyrus wa discovered 1109 in 1934 at manchester university 1110 it sent two ton of german scholarship to the flame 1111 here wa an ounce of evidence that proved a pound 1112 of presumption dead wrong 1113 and thats what christian have is we have lot 1114 and lot of ounce of evidence 1115 we have to recognize a problem 1116 the original autograph written by the apostle are gone 1117 lost to time 1118 what we have are the thousand of copy that survive 1119 but is that enough 1120 can we really rely on the bible if we dont even have 1121 the very first copy 1122 one of the most common question i receive is 1123 what good is a belief in an errancy if an errancy 1124 only applies to the original autograph 1125 and we dont have the original autograph 1126 so how can we believe in an errancy 1127 but i think that objection make a fundament mistake 1128 it assumes that when we talk about the original text 1129 that think of it a only a physical object 1130 a if we have to have the actual autograph 1131 in order to have access to the original text 1132 and since those physical object are lost 1133 therefore we dont have access to the original text 1134 but the text itself the word of god themselves 1135 arent necessarily a physical object 1136 that you can put in a museum 1137 the word of god can be preserved in other way 1138 beyond just the autograph and we think thats happened 1139 you see the more manuscript or scroll that you have 1140 the easier it is to reconstruct the original 1141 called the autographa autographa 1142 the autographa the original 1143 and check out any error or discrepancy 1144 and you try through the bibliographical test 1145 to create what is called a pure text 1146 what percentage of the original text do you know 1147 for sure today what percentage is a pure text 1148 the problem is the way i like to describe it is 1149 that we have 105 percent of the text 1150 we have the text a it wa and then we have the variation 1151 that have been introduced to the text and text criticism 1152 is the job of trying to pare off that 105 percent 1153 down to what we originally had 1154 and the place where were not sure are noted 1155 i tell people you actually have the opportunity 1156 to be a little bit of a textural critic 1157 because in some place in your bible 1158 in the margin note it will say or 1159 or some manuscript say and thats telling you 1160 those place that are really the most discussed 1161 a lot of the people out there talking about these thing 1162 sort of give the impression that every word is questioned 1163 and thats just simply not true 1164 at any level it not true 1165 99 percent of the text is sure 1166 there are yes there are some place 1167 in the greek text where we scratch our head and go 1168 i dont hm im not sure which one it is 1169 theyre called cratings in our bible 1170 so thing like spelling 1171 is it gadarenes or gergesenes 1172 is it bethsaida bethzatha or bethesda 1173 is the form of the verb esti or estin 1174 is there an n sound on the end 1175 it doesnt affect the meaning at all 1176 but we cant really tell 1177 a lot of that is thats what make up that one percent 1178 99 percent of the text were very comfortable with 1179 this is what wa originally said 1180 and just a importantly that one percent 1181 that were not sure doesnt bring 1182 any major christian doctrine into question 1183 there is simply is no major and i dont even think 1184 any minor doctrine thats raising the question 1185 i mean not many of u are gon na go to heaven or hell 1186 based on whether it gadarenes or gergesenes 1187 of the hundred of thousand of textural variant 1188 that we actually have the smallest group 1189 are those that are both meaningful and viable 1190 it le than onefifth of one percent 1191 of all textural variant and yet these are the one 1192 that christian and nonchristians always hear about 1193 the one that skeptic talk about 1194 the one that make the news because theyre so interesting 1195 and they seem to destroy the christian faith 1196 or uphold the christian faith 1197 it a very small fraction 1198 well you get textural variant of all kind 1199 perhaps the two most discussed in relationship 1200 to the gospel is the percopi where the woman caught 1201 in adultery in the middle of john john 1202 the last part of seven and eight 1203 and then the ending to the gospel of mark 1204 the only thing that is different about that passage 1205 is that it is a longer one 1206 most textural variant are a word or two 1207 whereas this is a whole unit 1208 in both of those case i would argue pretty strongly 1209 that those unit were not part of the original given by god 1210 but if you think that they are nothing much depends on it 1211 if you think that theyre not 1212 nothing much depends on it either 1213 the message of the bible is secure in any case 1214 when skeptic talk about how we cant get back 1215 to the original text because we dont have the original 1216 manuscript they typically have never examined 1217 the text of grecoroman literature 1218 if theyre right that we cant get back 1219 to the new testament then we might a well kiss 1220 the ancient world goodbye and the middle age 1221 would still be the dark age 1222 we would never have the renaissance 1223 because we cant possibly tell what these ancient said 1224 if were gon na be skeptical about the new testament 1225 on average we should be a thousand time 1226 more skeptical about grecoroman writing 1227 the textural richness of what is found 1228 in the new testament and now in the old testament 1229 with the discovery of the dead sea scroll 1230 is really very remarkable 1231 it utterly unique from documentation 1232 from the ancient world 1233 so god in his providence ha been wonderful 1234 in providing so much 1235 we would be at fault if we criticized him 1236 for not providing infallible copy with new miracle 1237 every time somebody picked up a pen 1238 how did the church come to embrace 1239 these new testament book 1240 were they chosen out of a list 1241 did a council determine their worth 1242 a the church grows and the religion formalizes 1243 what is the god 1244 who give authority to the bible 1245 there a perception again out there in the world today 1246 whether in popular literature or on the internet 1247 that there were vote that took place in council 1248 and that people put picked these book 1249 and that there wa some shady deal going on 1250 in a smokefilled room where one book barely got 1251 in by a vote and some book got out 1252 and i can tell you all of that is a misunderstanding 1253 of the way thing happened in the early church 1254 the fact of the matter is when it come to most 1255 of the book of the new testament again 1256 probably 22 23 out of the 27 there wa never 1257 any real discussion about them 1258 there wa never any real debate about them 1259 there wa never any sense that you had to decide 1260 on which book these were 1261 these were the book that were simply handed down 1262 to the early church in fact that language 1263 handed down we see used in numerous place 1264 throughout the second century where early church father 1265 refer to these book a the book that were passed down 1266 to them that were given to them by the apostle 1267 that were one that the church had always known 1268 you have these document produced in the first century ad 1269 by the second century ad we had a collection 1270 of the four canonical gospel 1271 and a collection of paul letter 1272 this we know 1273 in the second century ad these were already 1274 considered sacred text and you already have 1275 house church where people are saying 1276 bishop are saying were not gon na read 1277 from any text from the lectern 1278 or at the meeting except our sacred text 1279 or the sacred text of the old testament 1280 there were criterion that the church used to 1281 recognize these and these criterion are essentially three 1282 apostolicity which mean the book is either written 1283 by an apostle or an associate of an apostle 1284 and thats the most important criterion 1285 secondly is orthodoxy 1286 doe the book conform to what we know to be true 1287 from the other book that we know to be inspired 1288 the gospel were the very first one almost surely 1289 to be accepted 1290 we dont have any period when there wa a time 1291 when there wa any hint that they were not accepted 1292 and then the third criterion is catholicity 1293 that doesnt mean roman catholic 1294 it mean accepted by the majority of the church 1295 now there some that would be considered orthodox 1296 like the epistle of barnabas 1297 and that may be a first century document 1298 late first century document but the church 1299 recognized early on that the epistle of barnabas 1300 wa not written by barnabas 1301 any time the church recognized that a book 1302 wa not written by the name that it claim 1303 to be written by automatically it got rejected 1304 when it wa discovered that some deacon 1305 had produced the letter to the laodecians the bishop said 1306 not only are we not reading these in church 1307 were defrocking you for producing false document 1308 and the first person to name the book 1309 that make up our new testament wa athenasius 1310 and he did it in 367 ad in a letter on easter 1311 that wa written in that year 1312 irenaeus writing long before athenasius 1313 talk about four gospel he talk about act 1314 he talk about the pauline epistle 1315 he talk about first john and first peter 1316 thats the bulk of your new testament 1317 clearly being seen and utilized a inspired 1318 and valuable to the church 1319 at the end of the second century 1320 but whats interesting is if you go a little earlier 1321 if you go to the first part of the second century 1322 or the middle part of the second century 1323 and you read whats written there 1324 what you see are writer who may have access 1325 to one gospel or two they may have access to one 1326 two or three of the pauline epistle 1327 but they arent thinking of the new testament 1328 the way we think about it because they only had 1329 exposure and access to some of the work 1330 they hadnt some of the work hadnt circulated 1331 across the church yet 1332 when you look at the state of the canon 1333 in the early church there two important 1334 fact to get right about it 1335 one is to recognize that very early 1336 there wa a core collection of book 1337 that the church recognized almost out of the gate 1338 what that mean is by the second century 1339 weve got 22 maybe 23 out of the 27 book already there 1340 thats one thing to recognize but there a second thing 1341 to recognize and that is that there were 1342 some book that were disputed 1343 we have some book that you know we can call 1344 the book around the edge or the peripheral book 1345 the smaller book that there wa some more controversy about 1346 and these would be book like second peter 1347 and james and jude and second and third john 1348 and there wa some controversy about some of these book 1349 there wa some discussion about them 1350 the kind of book that typically 1351 were disputed were little book 1352 and this is noteworthy 1353 small book for obvious reason 1354 were not a impactful in the literature of the day 1355 they werent read a often they werent a widely known 1356 they were cited le so that they werent familiar 1357 across different geographical region 1358 so it would take more time to recognize these book 1359 and you can understand why they 1360 might be disputed more than others 1361 and here whats interesting 1362 despite occasional challenge here and there 1363 once the church had reached a consensus on these 27 book 1364 that consensus ha been wide and longstanding 1365 and i think thats an encouraging 1366 truth for u a christian 1367 we can look at the church through the age 1368 with a great deal of unanimity around these book 1369 not absolute unanimity where there never an objection 1370 from any quarter but a predominant unity 1371 which i think is evidence of the spirit work in the church 1372 to receive these 27 book and just these 27 book 1373 why dont we include some of these other book 1374 like the gospel of thomas or philip or mary 1375 or third corinthian or paul letter to the laodiceans 1376 or the act of paul or the revelation of john 1377 there a second revelation of john 1378 besides the one thats in the new testament 1379 or the revelation of peter 1380 why dont we include these book in the new testament 1381 there a fundamental reason why none of those are included 1382 and that is they are not first century document 1383 so they could not have been written by an apostle 1384 or an associate of an apostle 1385 that right there excludes all of these document 1386 what make thomas such an interesting work 1387 we think it a second century work of some kind 1388 is that it seems to have one element of source 1389 feeding into it that do come from jesus 1390 and another set of material 1391 that is coming from somewhere else 1392 it what i call a hybrid gospel 1393 and thats why it didnt make it into the canon 1394 is because what is represented by the hybrid 1395 is not a representation of the kind of orthodox 1396 christianity the other gospel reflect 1397 most scholar think that the gospel of thomas 1398 while it contains some really early material 1399 wa not assembled until the second century ad 1400 and the reason they assume that is because it seems 1401 to know all four canonical gospel 1402 well where could a person have been 1403 to have had access to all four 1404 canonical gospel together at one time 1405 that surely didnt happen before the second century ad 1406 the gospel of thomas ha in it last logion 1407 or last saying something that scholar are embarrassed by 1408 those who want it to go into our new testament 1409 theyre embarrassed or they really 1410 should be embarrassed by it 1411 peter start out bey saying 1412 let mary namely mary magdalene go out from u 1413 because woman are not worthy of the life 1414 and then jesus responds and he say 1415 look im gon na change her into a male 1416 so shell look like you guy 1417 so that she can make it into heaven just like you guy 1418 because any woman who make herself 1419 into a male is gon na get saved 1420 that really 1421 is that how we should view this 1422 let me tell you how the canon 1423 of the new testament wa not produced 1424 it wa not produced by the emperor constantine 1425 the supposed bad guy getting a bunch of people together 1426 and saying you need to get your act together 1427 tell me what are the sacred text 1428 you all decide right here at the council of nicea 1429 and were done 1430 the da vinci code myth 1431 about how the new testament wa created is just that 1432 it a myth it not historical fiction 1433 it hysterical fiction 1434 one main misconception is that the council of nicea 1435 wa where they chose the book of the new testament canon 1436 and in my field i hear that all the time 1437 that no one knew what book to read 1438 and then finally with constantine help 1439 we got it figured out at nicea 1440 that is patently false 1441 there is no evidence at all that the new testament canon 1442 wa a topic of conversation at nicea 1443 and so there no reason to think nicea really ha 1444 anything to do with what book were reading now 1445 the council at nicea wa about how to best articulate 1446 the divinity of jesus and the humanity of jesus 1447 so when we did articulate it we made sense 1448 and got it right and reflected the true reason of scripture 1449 and didnt contradict ourselves 1450 when it come to the question of the canon 1451 of the new testament or what book belong 1452 in the new testament there are two broad view 1453 within christendom 1454 one is that it an authoritative list of book 1455 the other is that it a list of authoritative book 1456 if it an authoritative list of book then that mean 1457 there is some authority over the new testament 1458 that it establishes what the new testament is 1459 thats the catholic view thats the greek orthodox view 1460 if it a list of authoritative book 1461 then there is no authority over the new testament 1462 that establishes the new testament a our final authority 1463 instead it the final authority 1464 you know i think the very first thing to recognize 1465 about the authority of scripture is that the word author 1466 is right there in the center of the word authority 1467 so the foundation for the authority of scripture 1468 can never be scripture and it can never be the church 1469 even a the believing community receiving scripture 1470 it go back by the very word to the author 1471 the ultimate author of scripture being god himself 1472 the bible ha authority in the sense 1473 that it is the word of god 1474 and therefore the authority is not so much 1475 in the black and white letter that we are seeing 1476 in that book but in the god who ha communicated with u 1477 if you remember when jesus wa being tempted by satan 1478 in the wilderness in the very first temptation 1479 satan say look jesus i know youre hungry 1480 youve been out here fasting for 40 day and 40 night 1481 and i know that you have the power to turn 1482 those stone into bread and to sate your hunger 1483 and jesus responds to satan by quoting moses 1484 from deuteronomy man shall not live by bread alone 1485 but by what 1486 every word that proceeds from the mouth of god 1487 and i think that when paul say 1488 all scripture god breathed 1489 just listen to that 1490 every word that come from the mouth of god 1491 i think paul ha jesus and moses in his mind 1492 when he say that 1493 so there you see moses view of biblical authority 1494 jesus view of biblical authority 1495 paul view of biblical authority 1496 in three greek word 1497 if the bible is reliable the question 1498 to the canon answered the mean of inspiration understood 1499 how do we interpret it 1500 are there true interpretation 1501 or is there just a sea of opinion 1502 is the bible a book locked in mystery 1503 only opened to the religious elite 1504 or can an ordinary person sit down 1505 and know what the living god ha to say to them 1506 before the reformation came 1507 a church service would have been very pedantic 1508 it would have been ritualistic 1509 and unfortunately often not understood 1510 you must understand that in catholic theology 1511 the idea is that the ritual itself the mass itself 1512 ha validity and therefore people dont even have 1513 to understand what is going on 1514 thats why the mass wa done in latin 1515 it didnt matter if you understood it 1516 a long a you were there a long a you were 1517 participating a long a somehow you were 1518 spiritually connected you did not need to know 1519 what the word were that were being spoken 1520 the catholic church attitude to the scripture 1521 in the run up to the 16th century 1522 and during the 16th century is quite intriguing 1523 certainly the intellectual hierarchy of the church 1524 regarded the scripture a important 1525 one of the reason they werent keen on laypeople 1526 reading the scripture wa they regarded them 1527 a important and had a concern that the scripture 1528 would be abused if they fell into the hand of laypeople 1529 on the other hand however the catholic church 1530 at i believe a demotic level at a grassroots level 1531 did not have a high view of the scripture 1532 the scripture did not feature highly in the piety 1533 of your typical parish priest 1534 didnt feature highly in the liturgical practice 1535 of the church 1536 there were of course very low literacy rate 1537 in europe at that time so no book functioned 1538 particularly significantly in the life of ordinary people 1539 one of the chief thing that reformer wanted to recover 1540 about the bible wa the sense of it clarity 1541 it perspicuity 1542 it really wasnt a debate that the bible wa authoritative 1543 everyone in christendom understood that it wa inspired 1544 and it wa infallible or they would have used 1545 some term similar to that but it wa often the clarity 1546 do we have to rely on priest 1547 on a magisterium on church tradition 1548 now we dont throw out those thing 1549 we dont come to the scripture by ourselves 1550 we do want to stand on the shoulder of giant 1551 to understand it but of course god wouldnt be god 1552 and he wouldnt be good if he didnt communicate with u 1553 in a way that we could understand 1554 since language is his idea anyways 1555 and since he saw fit to communicate and make himself known 1556 in language he want to be understood 1557 and the doctrine of the clarity of scripture 1558 asserts that if god want to be understood 1559 he is able to be understood 1560 now there are area of the bible 1561 that are harder for u to grapple with 1562 you know peter say the same of paul writing 1563 he say you know some of the stuff 1564 that he writes is not just real obvious 1565 well thats very helpful to me 1566 im glad he felt that way 1567 we studied daniel recently and daniel 1568 you know half the second half of daniel 1569 wa a great encouragement to me to realize that daniel 1570 when he wa on the receiving end of some 1571 of these revelation actually fell on the floor 1572 and then went to bed for two week 1573 because he wa so overwhelmed by it 1574 and he couldnt really figure it all out 1575 now that would be alarming if we were dealing 1576 with main thing and plain thing 1577 but there are certain thing that are even secret to god 1578 a deuteronomy 2929 tell u 1579 you know the thing that have been revealed are there 1580 and with some work with some hard work 1581 with some dependence upon the spirit of god 1582 with some help from those who are brighter than ourselves 1583 well be able to get to this 1584 because the bible actually is clear 1585 well there are many many wrong approach to scripture 1586 many individual example 1587 for example people sometimes cite philippian four 1588 i can do all thing through christ who strengthens me 1589 which warrant them to do anything they really want to do 1590 or a pastor can use it we would like you 1591 to teach such and such a sunday school class 1592 oh i cant do that 1593 oh you cant say cant you can do all thing 1594 through christ who strengthens you 1595 and the fact is no you cant 1596 i cant sing 1597 and you know i just cant sing 1598 thats not a gift that god gave me 1599 and i cant say i mean silly example 1600 but i cant do all thing through christ who strengthens me 1601 but the all thing is pointing back 1602 to what paul just said and paul just said 1603 i am content in all circumstance 1604 good time and bad 1605 persecution and not 1606 in having money and not having money 1607 i can do all these thing is what it really say 1608 i can do all these thing through christ who strengthens me 1609 so paul not just carte blanche saying 1610 christian can do anything they want 1611 but christian can learn to be content in all circumstance 1612 we cant make one part of scripture say something 1613 that contradicts the rest of scripture 1614 therefore if we are having difficulty with this section 1615 then perhaps we dont know the totality 1616 of scripture well enough to be able to place 1617 this properly and then to interpret it accurately 1618 we can say dogmatically god love the world 1619 we can say that without fear of being contradicted 1620 we may not know everything that we could know 1621 should know would like to know 1622 about the word god or even the word love 1623 or even the word world but nevertheless 1624 the proposition god love the world is a faithful 1625 interpretation of john three and many other passage 1626 we have to make clear the difference between 1627 meaning and significance 1628 sometimes people have tried to point out well 1629 look you can hear 10 different sermon 1630 about jesus encounter with the woman at the well 1631 and one preacher will make the text about evangelism 1632 and another one about apologetics 1633 and another about confronting sin 1634 another about how to befriend stranger 1635 and someone will say look no one can agree on the meaning 1636 well no the issue there is really significance 1637 the text of scripture will never be fully exhausted 1638 and any good preacher is going to find way to apply it 1639 in a number of different avenue 1640 but the meaning nevertheless is fixed 1641 that the meaning of the text is what the author intended 1642 to communicate by that text which dealing with scripture 1643 uniquely mean there is both the intention 1644 of the human author and sometimes even superseding that 1645 in way they may not have fully understood 1646 is the intention of the divine author 1647 we work on the basis of evidence 1648 not on the basis of speculation or weird idea 1649 or philosophy and whenever you argue 1650 with somebody who is not a believer 1651 they almost always bring in nonevidence 1652 well god would not have done this 1653 or this is really what i think happened 1654 it just all speculation 1655 let look at what the evidence say 1656 our faith is rooted in history 1657 and consequently we need to use the evidence 1658 and never be afraid of it 1659 half the battle of dealing with the trustworthiness 1660 or reliability of the bible is to know 1661 what are the subject of the bible 1662 and the subject of the bible are really pretty simple 1663 history theology and ethic 1664 the three major subject of the bible are history 1665 because we have a historical god 1666 who intervenes in human history 1667 it about theology the character of god 1668 and the character of his people 1669 and it about ethic 1670 how should we behave in response to all of that 1671 it very sad in our culture that weve seen 1672 the body of christ called charged and mandated 1673 to proclaim and even defend the faith 1674 but in many quarter the church ha denied 1675 questioned the faith 1676 were not to spin it nuance it change it 1677 undermine it were called to proclaim it 1678 the church of jesus christ always face 1679 a tremendous temptation and that is to deviate 1680 from the word of god 1681 and when we do that what happens 1682 first of all we may get wrong doctrine 1683 because we no longer see the clarity of the deity 1684 of jesus christ and the issue of salvation 1685 the other thing thats going to happen 1686 almost immediately is there is going to be 1687 a devaluation of moral teaching 1688 and pretty soon we begin to reason based on our own notion 1689 based on our own desire and the word of god is there 1690 but it is not believed it is not preached 1691 and it is not lived 1692 often a contemporary drifting church is very comfortable 1693 what is preached may sound very orthodox 1694 but it doesnt challenge anybody 1695 it doesnt call them back to the gospel 1696 where they are drifting 1697 this saying is attributed to martin luther 1698 so many pungent saying are 1699 im not sure if it come from him or not 1700 but it a true saying 1701 if you preach the gospel at every point 1702 except where the gospel is being challenged 1703 youre not preaching the gospel at all 1704 if you preach the gospel to a church 1705 at every point except the place where they need it 1706 or the place they need to be called back 1707 to obedience to god youre not preaching the gospel 1708 at all 1709 if you can get people to doubt the bible 1710 then you will get them sooner or later to deny 1711 but you have to doubt first before you can deny 1712 then a they deny then youre going to get them to disobey 1713 and thats worked so well since the garden of eden 1714 he hasnt had to change his tactic 1715 he still us it 1716 god made u for himself 1717 he ha made u for his own glory 1718 he communicates with u telling u how we ought to live 1719 through his word he ha given u an entire library there 1720 to fit into quite a lot of the various word 1721 in which we think and all that is authoritative 1722 so we dont go to the bible wanting to judge the scripture 1723 we go to the bible with a sense of submission 1724 wanting to hear what the living god ha to say to u 1725 and thats crucial 1726 i have a good friend who is famous for saying 1727 i love the word of god 1728 he love it and he doe he truly love the bible 1729 were talking about it one day and i said 1730 i have a question for you 1731 you love the bible dont you 1732 you love the word of god dont you 1733 yes i do 1734 i said do you love it author 1735 and do you know that there a difference 1736 and he just went blank 1737 it had never occurred to him that there 1738 wa something beyond bible study 1739 ive read from genesis to revelation in the bible 1740 and not once doe anyone ever have an encounter 1741 with the true and living god and come away and say 1742 it wa kind of boring and irrelevant 1743 he said people encounter god and die 1744 they encounter god and they are paralyzed with fear 1745 they encounter god and theyre overwhelmed with joy 1746 they encounter god and they cry because all their hope 1747 are realized but nobody ever encounter god and say 1748 that wa boring and irrelevant 1749 well when people say that about the bible it just say 1750 to me theyve not encountered the god of the bible 1751 if you think the bible is boring 1752 then either you dont realize what you need 1753 or youve never met the god that the bible talk about 1754 and very frankly i do think that there are a lot of people 1755 that are preacher by profession that have never met god 1756 or theyd never say his word is boring and irrelevant 1757 i love the way psalm 119 unfolds 1758 it the longest chapter in the bible 1759 and it all about the word 1760 and you see there what the word produce 1761 it produce delight 1762 it produce desire for god 1763 it produce obedience 1764 so sometimes it helpful to look at a text like psalm 119 1765 and say what doe it look like and feel like 1766 whats the experience of the person of the heart 1767 of the soul thats been captivated by the word of god 1768 and you see there theyre singing the word 1769 theyre storing up the word theyre treasuring god word 1770 they have the greatest sense of delight in it 1771 they are pained when people dont follow it 1772 it their greatest longing to obey it 1773 they see god character and smile and thats what we want 1774 thats why having the right view of scripture matter 1775 because without it were going to come to 1776 not only wrong conclusion about god and the gospel 1777 and ourselves but we wont think rightly 1778 we wont feel rightly we wont be the sort 1779 of human being that god made u to be 1780 if we dont take him at his word and understand all 1781 that he mean for u to know about himself 1781 please rate this
